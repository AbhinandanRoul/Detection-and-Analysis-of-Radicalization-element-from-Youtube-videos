RSS follow the same principle of Taliban , Just see the level of fake propaganda this guy is throwing with confidence 🤣🤣🤣. I thought he would be a random BJP fan, but now I see that he&#39;s a man with common sense. This man is born stupid.<br>Hindus are good, but people like this man are increased . How do the quranic verses become non-threatening if taken into account the time that they were written? It doesn&#39;t change the meaning, does it? Truth sucks right I wrote the below to one person who is organizing a conference against Hinduism in the USA: @John Adam John Adam was an American hero. John Adams fought for the rights of American people. You should not have his name. You are a traitor to the USA. You know if the terrorist Pakistan wins, they will eventually destroy America. Do you really believe they have any love for Americans? You know obviously the conference is taking money from the Pakistani side of the war or their lackeys. Clearly Pakistan is behind Taliban driving the Americans out of Afghanistan. So next they need to attack India. They actually believe they can be a superpower with India under their control. But with the Modi government there, they know they won&#39;t succeed so they try their best to use people like John Adam and the conference to defame India and let other terrorists like Sonia Gandhi take over; so India can be handed over to Pakistan just like the Americans gave all to the Pakistanis. John, you are playing the wrong hand. India is too strong to be defeated by a terrorist state. God is in India, do you really think anyone can defeat God?<br>John Adam 5 hours ago   @Prashobh Karunakaran Americans have no fixation with Pakistan. Why do Indians have this obsession with Pakistan ? You pretend to be some sort of world power. Yet, with your fixation with a country that is only 1/7th the size of India, I would say that you are not even a regional power, and you are a weak nation. The conference is not about Pakistan or Taliban, it is about Hindutva, aka Hindu Nazism. Are you saying Hindutva is from Pakistan ? I am not impressed with India or Indians. You have feeble minds.<br>Prashobh Karunakaran 2 seconds ago @John Adam You don’t know anything about India. India split into the Hindu side and the Pakistan side. The Pakistan side killed off the remaining 12.9% of Hindus who were living there in 1947. Then they worked upon killing off the Muslims who are not as “pure” as the leadership group. They will never get out of purification of their population and start developing their economy. Therefore they have to survive as a terrorist state and get prodded on by the worldwide military industry. Comparatively, India kept her Muslim population which actually grew in % since Independence. The Christians population % also increased since 1947. So what NAZISM=HINDUTYA=HINDU are you talking about? Pakistan may be 1/7 of India but started all four wars against India. Failing all wars, they sent plain clothes terrorist to India and one time they sent terrorist to the USA on 9/11/2001 and multiple times all over Europe. All terrorist activities in the world can be linked to Pakistan. The world need Hindus as a counter to Pakistan, if you want to keep your countries safe. If your neighbour stays in a tiny hut but has attacked your home countless times, aren’t you concerned about him? I already mentioned that I am officially an “outcast” but that did not stop my ancestors being owners of the region where they came from. You think a few Brahmins or Kshatriya can control the large number of “outcast”?  The exacerbation of the domination of one caste over the other may have been the case at one time. Categorising all current day Indians casteist is just a ploy of Westerners to get Hindus to convert to their violent religions; it is similar to calling all current day Americans the absolute worst kind of slave abusers, who actually sat in their homes to see two Black men fight to their deaths for their entertainment. You are totally feeble and it shows in your inconsistency in your statements above where you jump from one topic to another. Get some balls to talk straight; yes feminism has destroyed that for Americans. 1 tea and a confession. ppl are aware the facts he says and the facts from the texts and videos! Ohh man...Islam is the religion which supports the EDUCATION OF WOMEN ....Rasulallah (s.a.w.) said &quot;SEEKING KNOWLEDGE IS AN OBLIGATION UPON EVERY MUSLIM&quot;....Even the first university in the world , THE UNIVERSITY OF AL QARAWIYYIN ,was established by  FATIMA AL- FIHRI ,a Muslim women who established this university in year 859 , which is the first degree granting educational institution in the world (even recognized by UNESCO and Guinness World Record) Who want bharat as hindu rastra ? <br>  🙋🏻\\u200d♂️ Fu*k you left , Proud Hindu Jab tmhari islam sy dushmani hey tu musalman sy b hey aur jab christenity sy dushmani hey tu christen sy b hey <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m18s\">2:18</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m25s\">2:25</a> this is not written anywhere in Bible.

Atleast he is very crisp , clear and straightforward in his idealogy unlike this channel which seems some kind of propagandanist. This is what almost every Indian is not-accepting coz of Sickularism🤡. <br>Every Hindu,Sikh,Bhuddhist and Jains of India should be a nationalist then will see how these religious extremists of Islam and Christianity will stand in front of us. His Views Based On His Experience. He Is Straightforward Man. If You Want Him To Be Liberal (Pseudo Liberal) Give Him His Ancestral Land And House. Yes, exactly... I am enemy of Islam not muslims. He is wrong in saying mahabharata was a matriarchy it was rather a women who stood up against the patriarchy for her respect and pride vow to teach each and everyonr not to mess with her This man is smarter than 99% of these woke kids of insta mahabharata wasnt a matriarchal society? bruh, draupadi had five husbands, the god krishna&#39;s name is hailed after the name of radha. and every stories of mahabharata has equal if not more prominent female characters.<br>matriarchal doesnt mean they should be in war field, woman can dominate world with diplomacy and other things and we had that.<br>im from south india, our women were braless till 18th century, who introduced the concept of sin and shame? Mei bhi hindu nationalist This is fake Hmari pavitra bhagwat geeta <br>Sbse pavitra hai🚩🚩 <b>If this is hindu nationalism then I am proud to be one!</b> This man is awared and witnessed a lot in life rather  a radical.. Hindu nationalist 🙋🏾\\u200d♂️🇮🇳🚩 He seems to be very sensible man talking truth Thats what i dont like about right wing . The only thing they knows is violence .  They think ,they are the only one suffering in the world.<br>As if we are not tired of writing letter to MLAs and all . But we dont choose violence .<br>I m not actually leftist. I m tilted toward left from the centre thats all . Only because not leftist minds dont think about getting rid of others . They always find a middle way to achieve peace. <br><br>This is a proven fact . That if a leftist person is being guilty of a crime . Everyone , be it right wing or left wing , all would want him punished.<br>But when a right wing person is guilty in a crime ,the right wing people willl defend him . Look at this this guy in the video he is like &quot; agar unko pita hoga to sahi ho kiya hoga usne &quot; .<br>This mentality is what i hate about right wing. Hey did we ever saw anywhere mind of a Jihadist or Christian missionary when horrible crimes have been done by them over history. Be a atheist.. Not beleive on any God.. This is the most way to lead a simple life During Partition, M population got 2 new  countries. What did Hindus get? To decline his clear stance and concrete claims you had to come up with that tag on top 🤣🤣🤣 I see you got some serious 🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣 I&#39;m proud to be Hindu nationalist by your logic if you dare to ignore so many Christian and b u sslam nation and target only one faith ??? Well the Christian missionaries are duping people, converting them Plzz verify your proofs saying that we never had a matriarchial society and women were oppressed in our society. <br>And also, as you contacted this Chaiwala, please go contact some Puncture repair shop muslim mindset with his allah talla gifted sons or a christian missionary mindset The Islamic invasions and Christian crusades prove the THEY ARE PEACEFUL &quot;(unsubstantiated claim)&quot; ?!..  maybe YOU guys should make a placard and hang that around your neck every time you open your mouth. Bloody whiner! How is force feeding beef any different from stopping another from eating beef This is west teaching such a old civilization how to govern<br>Where plastic surgery was practied first<br>Where sugar was first discovered <br>One day They will starve karma will hit you This man should be a politician ! What a legend I would take a hindu extremist over a Islamic one any day Once M population reaches 51% in lndia, will the country remain secular? The Title of this Video is totally WRONG.... Proud Toxic a-hole. Vedas have the same type of verses but he will not talk about that My man I am proud of you 🔥 Hindu Republic of Nepal and Bharat very soon. Every word of his is justified<br>..just pseudo secularism on its peak ..dats why no one&#39;s gonna admit the fact!!! Jai hindutva NOW WE ARE IN POWER AND WILL GOVERN THE UNIVERSE,  JAI SHREE RAM 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Now i understand what he means when he said &quot;Indian Women were oppressed and not educated after Islam came to India.&quot; Till now, I thought he was prejudiced and trying to blame his people&#39;s mistakes on Muslims. Now we can actually prove him 100% right by giving examples, Look at what is happening in Afghanistan even today.. <br><br>Girls can no longer go to School, They can&#39;t even leave homes. Ancient India invented Kama Sutra, Women wore short revealing clothes like Tribal Folk still do in India, Lets not forget the Hindu Goddess of Knowledge and Wisdom is herself a Woman - Godess Saaraswati, Similar to Greeks who worshipped Athena.. So what wrong he said .....each and every word said by him is true .... I am not bjp supporter and I hate Savarkar( coward) but finds logic behind this man&#39;s word. This is somewhat looks like educated bhakt. I don&#39;t know why he caught me  with his talk. If he is hindu nationalist then I want every hindu to be like him He has a lot wrong about Christians and the Bible ❤️❤️❤️ sab sach bola Usne tay kiya ye son of god hai 😁😁😁 Diplomat didnt ask him to substantiate his claims but later edit in unsubstantiated claims 💯💯 facts<br>Everything he said is true Idk but racism exist in hindu community. They dont let lower class people in temples. What wrong did he said ? All I heard are heavy facts and points. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0U9KDQnIsNk\">https://youtu.be/0U9KDQnIsNk</a> Pakistan has wiped out their 28 percent of their minorities at that time i don&#39;t know why the diplomat is silent, i think something is in their mouth. भारत माता के इस हिंदू सपूत को सौ सौ प्रणाम। What a bakwaa man..apne bhai ko maro....quran me...my God...sick guy... 😂😂😂india is more voilent than pakistan waah bete waah ....kha se laate ho ye chutiya reports jay shree ram Islam attankwad hai There is no going back from the point we are in. Modi has been very successful in mindwashing the civil society. Radicalisation is normalised. You can google the &quot;unsubstantiated claim&quot; you&#39;ll find they&#39;re true. Instead of saying they&#39;re false, say they&#39;re contested . Millions of hindus lives in Gulf and these are the mentality of them🤡 Idk about other stuff but his Christian history is wrong.<br>Umm Constantinople didn&#39;t wrote Bible, he was made Christian on his deathbed, and after he died, Christianity become the official language in Rome.<br>Also, as I said, he was not a Christian, he even didn&#39;t knew anything about Jesus as obviously bible was not written then, he followed Nordic gods like Zeus.<br>So yea, this is a history lesson :) looks like diplomat&#39;s propaganda is hijacked by people with common sense Sidhi baat, no bacwas <br>💯👍🚩🇮🇳 आधा ज्ञान Next we want video on Mind of Taliban. There is no command in the New Testament to cause any harm to a non-Christian. That is false. Also, there is a difference between political powers doing things in the name of the God of the Bible and actual Biblical Christianity.<br><br>The most a Biblical Christian will ever do is annoy you and offend you with message of the Gospel. Peaceful, Biblical Christians must spread the Gospel to all people because sin is destructive and only Jesus Christ can save our souls. Our spiritual situation is that dire. We cannot earn salvation.<br><br>Please read the Bible for yourself. It is nothing like Islam. Jesus said to love our enemies and do good to those who curse us. Persecuting Christians is not going to stop the message of the Gospel from spreading and saving souls. We all need a Savior and Jesus Christ alone is that Savior. I say this in love. Respect this man He is speaking truth. He is not an extremist. Tabhi. Gay. Khatea. Hea. Bagdadi. Jeso. Ka. Kema. Katta. Hea. Gay<br>Ko. Maa. Jo. Mantea. Hea. Vo. 800<br>Sao Saal. Sea. Mitta. Nahi He&#39;s not even an extremist.<br>He is just spitting true facts. This is actually a mind of hindu nationalists,He says he is against the religion not the people following it,does it make sense?.He is mumbling references he heard from television, which is not even a complete reference. He is not a nationalist but an extremist.Go and listen to people like zakir naik who actually have knowledge about many religions not this who doesn&#39;t even know his religion Hinduism teaches not to worship idols.This is not common sense,this is trying to provoke for evil. I am proud to be a Hindu nationalist. Hope this reporter take some lessons from Danish Siddiqui about radicalism. Diplomat...😪 Such bad reporting. Cleverly crafted subtitles. Damn,I am impressed and proud how hindu nationalist are rational 😀 Jai shree ram death to Hindutva. I tried to find one sentence of his which was wrong, but seems like a perfectly rational guy! <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fascistindia\">#Fascistindia</a> So much misinformation Aurangzeb killed 4.6 million hindus still called great in ncert books because the starting 5 education minister of India are maulanas<br>Vir maharana pratap maharaj won the battle of haldighati but still akbar win in the ncert books<br>They call invaders great and no mention for the veers who shed thier blood for this nation Dislikes on this video are showing that they would understand with Arrows not vows. ❤️ It show how to make a anti hindu propaganda....

Their enemies told them look at Muslims recognise them they are u enemies You have been posting about liberal&#39;s interpretation in the end of his arguments , for which we clearly don&#39;t give a flying fuck . &quot;Christian and Islam teaches hate for Disbelievers&quot; <br>- Blah Blah Liberal Scholars deny this Allegation.<br><br>&quot;Liberal Hindu believes that Mahabharata time Hindu society had matriarchal society&quot;<br>- Blah Blah Scholars Denys.<br><br><br>Do you see a common theme?<br>They will always blame Hindus and portray them and their scriptures in a negative sense.<br>On the other side, they will portray Christianity and Islam as the most Liberal religions.<br><br>It&#39;s time to wake up Hindus. Do this: Mind of indian islamist So this is another propoganda video to defame hindu voices. We have just 1 country and u have problem with that also Every word from his mouth is so true ☑️. I am nationalist. Modi nai ku jeeta gujrat ko bool gaiyai .kashmir mai more than 90000 muslim  mardeyai army walo  nai Real whattsapp uncle Its amazing how brainwashed he is. Jai shree ram I am a proud HINDU NATIONALIST ah yes the radicalists are everywhere I like him much I came to see how they would feature an ass to show bigotry but this guy eloquently put a factually correct point forward... Yes that is mee too . I don&#39;t hate muslims and christians . I hate islam and christianity . someone who believed in many gods and goddesses to see. Hinduism is sometimes  Misunderstood to be a polytheistic religion,   belief means believing believing in lots of Ultimate Reality. Is, is that contradiction in terms? You can do more than one ultimate it because your argument enough Hinduism has never been a polytheist tradition. It is always been a very mature, pluralistic tradition not many gods, but many ways to relate to the idea of spirituality. it can incorporate monotheism means accepting one supreme personality. <br><br>it can incorporate non-theistic approaches as well as non Religious approaches, for making spiritual progress. This is called spiritual democracy .. in the lovely word is &quot; religious pluralism&quot;.<br> Many paths for exploring spirituality..<br>, so it&#39;s the same. There is one ultimate Supreme. Being?<br> not being, we say is the principle that under being  is reality, which is essentially spiritual rather than material, that manifests itself in different layers of material Level. And this demarcation between for like, man God n  universe is very artificial. we demolish .. India will burn in hell because of these nationalists. The country was already a shithole and the nationalists are adding more shit I thing this man is paid to say such intentionally to derogate Hinduism more precisely Fxxk you paid presstitutes media. I&#39;m proud to be a hardcore Hindu nationalist.🔥 I salute this brother,I like his thought....Every Indian should learn it I need hindurashtra I proud to be a hindu nationalist Jai Hind! I am fascist What a Smart and Proud Man... I salute him. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m40s\">6:40</a><br>Before calling this fact an unsustainable claim <br>Read history and core sanatan beliefs.

We should better report these types of biased channel .<br> They create such videos with the intention to defame INDIA and Hindu Community Radical mind setup. Chapter nine is Al-Tawha which means repentance also it says that &quot;If any one of the idolaters should seek your protection, grant it to him so that he may hear the word of God, then take him to a safe place for him, for they are people who so not know. &quot; It further says &quot;so long as they are true to you be true to them&quot;. What he said was absolutely out of context, the words that he used was described for war when idolaters were attacking to Mecca. I also can&#39;t believe the amount of people who said they found reason in what he said. Terrified of what India is becoming. He said nothing wrong Everything in brackets has been added shamelessly Brainwashed !! No wonder India is going down. Ok though all of his points are not valid..but this man has got some major points to be considered 👍🏻 Satti, child marriages talk about them The first 35 seconds of this documentary was enough to tell me I am watching a sanghi Hindu Taliban हिन्दू राष्ट्र तो बन के रहेगा U r basically blind ANTI-HINDU He is a common indian man with some common sense. <br>Huge respect to this guy. Please don&#39;t utter useless words if you don&#39;t know about Christianity 🙏, Your claims regarding Christianity is totally fraud, We also live in the same country just as you are Indian so We are also. Ciristan missionary and islmic both are tirrorests jai hindu rastra Heres a man that won&#39;t last long in kerala Kya galt bola v sahi bola jai shree ram 🙏 Came to see here a brain washed radical...only found common sense and truth 💪🏻🚩🇮🇳 I thought the guy was stupid but he has pretty good knowledge. Jinnah and modi were ethnic gujarati including javed miandad amit shah etc One man opinion dose not mean opinion of Hindus there are many Muslim who have more hate Poppet muhammad biggest prankster of mankind 😂 India will be Christian by 2050 so many muslims want to become aetheist or adopt hinduism but they are in fear if they convert no hindu caste will accept them jab aayate bata di fir kya reh gya. India k secular pro right islamic na bane kuki secular to india pehle se hi hai. Now Europe is facing Secularism ... facts clearly He is right.... Our hindu society has flourished under 1400 of Muslim rule..... It&#39;s not unsubstantiated....plus he is actually quite tolerant for an extremist.... I want to see an Islamist now Please also make such video about Muslim and Christian also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=4m10s\">4:10</a> subtitles are manipulated. He is saying we are being heard not we have an influence. here we can clearly see the motivation. Vedas is also analtered ,written book which often goes through amendments as per the wishes of high class society like indian constitution . Hindutva can wank off! You can&#39;t just ask the people of thier own religion to answer if what he is saying is wrong.<br>Christianity: deuteronomy 13:6-10<br>Islam: Surah At-Tawbah - 1-129 <br>He isnt wrong I read it <br>It told that stone him to death even if it is your own brother, son or daughter believes in any other god.<br>And It told that Allah wont bless the polythiests (I think didnt understand the Passage) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a><br>Pakistan better than India because there are no minority left there now. he is an ignorant bigot who does not know his own history and most of his claims are false I&#39;m an indian muslim<br>He said that..<br>Muslim is not a problem islam is probelm... Christians are not creating problems but Christianity..<br><br>Same for me<br>Hindus are not probelms hindutva is not a problem santhan dharama is not a problem<br>Bjp and rss are the problems💯 Bilkul sahi isko bolte hai ache sanskaar🙏🏻🔥🙏🏻🔥 Very knowledgeable person. Who said putin is anti muslim . faltu bakbak mat kar.   Putin highly respects islam and russia has a huge history of islam from tsar . putin also is a valuable follower of russian orthodox christianity . he also questioned nato why they attacked libya. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=0m14s\">0:14</a> now that&#39;s a lot of damage 😂😂 Hindu extremists Rape of women happened in india because of islam?wtf kuch bhi True ❤️❤️ Truely explained to save Hindustani culture , which is need of the hour to save us from Jihadi Terrorism .

Ah I wish Muslim extremists were as &quot;radical&quot; as this man KING 👑 How can you blame him? His family had to cross the border amid terrible violence, leaving behind everything and the RSS helped him in his life immensely.

Jai hind🇮🇳 This guy talking is a brainwashed bakht, common sense? He has enmity, a hostile attitude towards other belief systems, what he fails to understand is the majority Muslims and Christians were Hindus at one point who accepted a different belief. Islam was not forced in the population of India otherwise majority today would be Muslims? Hindu khatray ma hai 🤣🤣 That guys dosent even know the verse.. bruh I mean like it’s the exact same, India dosent make life any easier to Muslims Brainwashed!

Funny he didnt mention Jews as they are Abrahamic religion same  as Christianity and Islam As a Muslim I appreciate this guy until he&#39;s said Islam is the cause of rape in India. Like dude Indian is the rape capital of the world. Before Islam you used to rape dalits women&#39;s and burn them in sati system and pre Islamic India was the pathetic era for womens even Raja ram Mohan Roy said that too. Gyan kothik kerl lala itna jhut mat pel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=1m51s\">1:51</a> As usual the same verse out of context 😂🤦\\u200d♂️ That seems like a reasonable guy, not extremist Full of hatred about Muslim and Christian... Ashoka was Buddhist you idiot 🙄 Dear i am from future u are now aam admi party supporter after u r not vaccined u was suffering from covid and bjp nata doesn&#39;t pick u r phone 😉 Tell me a better oxymoron than a liberal Muslim this guy is a brain washed bastered Punjabis, Sindhis, Bengalis. Wake up and remember what your ancestors went through. All diaspora Hindus n Indians should go back to the Motherland. Constantine wrote bible 👏👏🤦🤦🤷 We don&#39;t give a dam what he thinks or says. All the facts about writing of Bible are simply in correct. All the new testament was written with in 1st century. And no where in New Testament is it asked to stone a person to death.<br>Lol, literally this is the mind of  Hindu Nationalist. A mind with no facts and full of violence. Can&#39;t believe with such a toxic ideology exist....I feel disgusted  to even breathe the same air as them. As atheist and religious phcolgist say ..thus man has a pre meditated believe. ..which does not count as a belief but is an action or his action plan for safety and or power. I  feel sad at the level of inhumanity RSS  is putting inside mind of people.  Not a single claim he made he can prove.  RSS is the cancer for which India is suffering right now. the worst thing this guy did was not know every nook and cranny of religions he does not follow nor like, I bet 5 bucks that if I unprompted asked the interviewer to name me an avatar of Vishnu they would have no clue &quot; ISLAM IS A GREEN CANCER FOR ALL WORLD &quot; And Our &quot; POLITICIANS , SECULARS &quot; Is Helping &quot; THEM &quot; For Makeing &quot; GAZWA - E - HIND &quot; Requesting To All Hindu Brothers and Sisters &quot; TRUST ON OUR HINDU RELIGION &quot; And Always Remember &quot; PARTISION &quot; Was Made On Only One Basis &quot; HINDUSTAN FOR ONLY ALL HINDUS AND PAKISTAN FOR ALL MUSLIMS &quot; That Time Not Anybody Use And Understanding &quot; WORD &quot; &quot; SECULAR &quot; Hinduism was never about extremism!!<br>Swamy Vivekananda ne hinduo ko jaisa bataya vaisa hota hai hindu....<br>Ye sab log aaplogo aaj dharm par bhadkayenge..<br>Kal Caste par...<br>Baad me language par...<br>Fir East West india ,north south india...<br>Inlogo ko chodho....Aap lo padho likho desh ka naam raushan karo....ye tukde karne ki koshish karte rahenge...

Hindu rastra hotehi  🗡️👈🚩 Wow, he is the biggest landura expert of all time uneducated people 😂😂😂 Great india should be hundurastra\\U0001f6d5🕉🕉🕉🕉🕉 So, this media is trying that hindus remain die &amp; vanish from earth. <br>If hindus raise voice against violence then it termed as Hindu extremist.. bilkul islam anay ke baad sab buriyan ayein sathi tradition bhi islam nay shuru karaya tha If you think this is extremism then come to my home I will tell you what hindu extremism is 😂 people have wrong perception of nationalism. nation is not a single community that speaks same language  living in a territory. a nation is the conclusion of a long shared history of different communities so people should stop linking nationalism with religion. Jai sreeram... Diplomat.. we know your propoganda.. your survey is utterley lie.. Unite all Dharmic religions and make Bharat-Varsh great again! Arya Samaj amar rahe 💛 Whatever he said about quran and bible is right it is clearly mentioned in quran and bible to kill non believers but the fun fact is that only muslims follow that trend not christians! 😭🤟<br>his familly is from Pakistan 😭 The ugly voice of a supremacist. Utter BS Honest and straightforward. We need more people like him. Anyone watching from UAE or KSA? He is a sick person<br>Sick mentality Yeah, he’s a racist/nationalist for sure, guised under a thin veil of self proclaimed victimization and using what sounds like reasonable arguments to defend vile actions against others. None of it justifies his proclaimed actions and thinking. Racists and nationalists don’t want to be perceived as carrying out blatantly racist and negative actions against others so they portray themselves as victims to pull a veil over people’s eyes (and sometimes their own eyes too). Still, it amounts to the same thing and the effects are often the same. Murder, hate, genocide and killings. Some white Europeans used to claim that the whip was good for slaves because it’s how they understood things. Their justifications were worth about as much as this guy’s. Curse on you coward lier Sabka malik ek vobhi Allah hai❤️ After all he didn&#39;t acted he was a honest man.. Twisted mind. Don&#39;t have any knowledge of Islam or Christianity. A totally different lot coming out of Hindu schools, Muslim maddrasas<br>Christian missionary schools with no knowledge or respect for other religion and feed upon hatred for other religion&#39;s. He has point Hindu Nationalists abuse your loved ones.<br>This man will not.<br>This is the only difference.<br>The rest is same.<br>Stupidity.<br><br>Refutation of Quran 9:5 Claim<br><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CI96i7hHzqX/?utm_medium=copy_link\">https://www.instagram.com/p/CI96i7hHzqX/?utm_medium=copy_link</a> there is not any muslim country which have democracy but there is not any hindu majority country which dont have democracy Kutiyapa ...suthiya aadha doctor hai ... Galat kya bola <br>Salo muslim national anthem me khada nahi hota tab toh tumhari gaand nahi jalti I bet he didn’t even read bible and Quran 11K Dislikes by Fools Who Don&#39;t have any answers to his Counter Questions stupid ideology never comes true, it&#39;s just a day-dream . one more think Putin is not a anti-Muslim image. People like him come to all religions are fully brainwashed n threaten for the nation। The fact that this man feels that it&#39;s ok to just beat people up just because of anger and to target collectively a minority is just sickening . He and others of his mindset are really of low intellect..democracy only on paper if the village isiot makes enough noise all the other village idiots will join him .. shame India   please catch up to Human Rights for Real People. Putin is not an anti-muslim you moron. Putin is a very intelligent man. Merkel has invited over 1 million Muslim refugees to Germany. WTF is this guy talking about? This guy is literally empty from the head. I pray Modi stays the PM of India for the next 20 years. I cannot wait to see where he is going to take India :D Congress was dangerous for Pakistan because Manmohan Singh was very quiet but the economy of India was booming. Modi on the other hand is very loud but the economy is hitting the ground. India would be dangerous if it becomes an economic power. Big talks and Rafale isn&#39;t going to help India in the long term and wouldn&#39;t threaten Pakistan. Brainwash😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Do one more the mind of a jihadi also .. Yah thats why you people burn them alive with their dead husband this is because of islam tell my all you radical nuggets Bas ek verse Quran ya Bible ki verse   par li to samaj lia ki ye religion he galat hai.Bhaiya jo disbeliever ka kaha hai to ye bhi Quran mein likha hai ki kisi ko force na karo.Koi compulsory nahi aur ye bhi likha hai ki jab tak koi tumhe na marne aaye to tum bhi maat <a href=\"http://karna.ye/\">karna.Ye</a> kabhi read kia bhi hai ki nahi?<br><br>Al-Baqarah 2:256<br>There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion.

And whoever saves one -  it is as if he had saved mankind entirely</b> . And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors. Its because of people like him that India will always be a third world country Xd 😂 Typical Hindu mindset, sun be agar Islam se dushmani hai to 2 billion people se dushmani hai teri... They hate muslims. But during debates they will never acknowledge that.. They are so blind that they think Killing a man for carrying beef is normal!! <br>This is called Fascism!! Kitna jhot bole ga hamari aurte tu hijab pehanti he pori dunya janti  jai.hamara den sharam sikhata hai Me pakistani  maine aj tak.

He has clarity in his disagreement with Abrahamic religion and his way conveying his thoughts is so subtle.|<br>I don&#39;t know, may be something is wrong with me. What a nationalism only hatred The fun part is that he says that Islam and Christianity are doing violence but then justifies the violence he and his religions does. This is how hypocrisy of these sick people work. <br><br>How can a person be so ignorant yet so confident about something he has no knowledge about. <br>And this man justifies killing of one person because someone else was killed. Now I saw some actually libral true speech You know that happened between hindu and muslim we all forget the preface of constitution &quot; WE THE PEOPLE OF INDIA....&quot; I hope you understood. And got the answer. Is bhai ka kya back ground hai total andhbhakth hai isse koi matlab nahi hai insaniyat se isse tho bas matlab hai minority , apna phone ghuma ke kaam karwa lo.

But India will never become a single religious country. They tried to show him bad but ended in glorifying him reject religion<br>embrace humanity If we are bigots just for defending ourselves and our faith, then we shall be the biggest bigots on the face of this Earth!

Like Jews, Hindus have no other land to emigrate. Hindus are Stateless in Pak/B&#39;desh and CAA is for them. Even Jawaharlal Nehru said so. Let me Quote - <br><br>“…..the Hindu idea of nationalism was definitely one of Hindu nationalism. It was not easy….to draw a sharp line between this Hindu nationalism and true nationalism. The two overlapped as India is the only home of the Hindus and they form a majority there.” <br><br>— Jawaharlal Nehru, in “Glimpses of World History”, (OUP : 1985, p. 677) If I come to India can I eat beef ? Also, I am a muslim. Is it ok for me to visit India ? I do say Allahu Aqbar, but only occasionally, not all the time.

How many of Indian Muslims have killed non Muslims? How many Moulvis who better understand Quran and Indian students to kill? Why this sentiments have huge increase in last 20 years and not in the of last 70 years?<br><br>If Hindu are so peaceful, why Hindus attack and kill Muslims? Sorry to hear that your family had to move from what is now Pakistan to what is now India. I know someone who is very close to me that had to move from Miamwali, Pakistan to Phugwara India.<br>But you don&#39;t need to worry. Good thing you made to India unharmed. Because millions of Muslims living in Eastern Punjab in Ferozpur, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Gurdaspur who were majority in their district were killed and annihilated by Hindus and Sikhs during partition time no verse in bible says to punish a non believer in fact its stated that non should go against another religion or disrespect them<br>and the main thing bible wasnt written by Constantine<br>seriously he didnt<br>khuch bhi<br>admitting as violent person himself and talking tarsh to other <br>iss ko toh.... chal jane dey 😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m32s\">6:32</a> BCZ OF ISLAM WOMAN GOT THE EDUCATION EMPOWERMENT .

Hindu ekta zindabad.. this comment section makes me want to drink bleach 🧡 Daya aati hai aise logo par 16k likes and 11k dislikes this message should be enough for the diplomats to consider that this is new india, can&#39;t be influenced easily influenced by such mere propoganda. The way they have picked such a person, and edited the conversation, tht can be clearly seen, as we can&#39;t see the reporter talking about ashoka, but in the last the guy picked up that point. Not everyone is like that, I partially disagree with him, I am not against any religion or its people. But ik 16k people would have started hating a &#39;bhakt&#39; Quoting from Manu Pillai, on Periyar :<br><br>Periyar viewed nationalism as a finely woven, brilliantly designed deception,  diverting masses of people from the real state of affairs, sometimes through emotional blackmail and sometimes through the intoxication of pride, keeping them from checking the book of democratic accounts. Extremist are idiots Tumara religion tumare liye <br>Hamara religion hamare liye Hindus justify extremism. 11000 butthurt Extremist Hindu Indians (not all Indian) disliked it! My full support to this man. This man is spitting facts. And facts are bitter, If you want to destroy ☪️ Islam<br>Purchase only electronic vehicles and development of electronic vehicles will destroy Saudi Arab. Aadhi adhuri knowledge khatre se khali ni Hoti... Heheheh hilarious how the Makers of the video we’re trying so hard to show him in a Bad light but he was so well articulated that they couldn’t religious violence ho rha hai...but not on abrahamic minorities instead on indic religion....you are showing fake graphs and fake research spreading....lies....indian Hindus are not clamping down on minorities instead facing problems from them....but these people never stop spreading propaganda.... The diplomat is really good<br>I am planning to become a paid subscriber This guy is not far right. He is a classical liberal, a libertarian. Yes he studied in such environment what can I expect from them. Now they blame islam for women abuse where Islam suports women education . Female abuse was there too in ancient India too ,this person is lying And this is an example that you should not judge a book (here holy bible)  by its cover (here without understanding the context) and now see the works of bjp which are now not too good after 3 year now aap is best <br><br>The verse he reffered to in bible was in the old testment which was changed in New Testament if Christianity was this bad then way did Jesus forgive those who killed him <br><br>And to know his mentality <br>He says if government is doing something good for a group of people to uplift them and is not in our favour then we should beat the absolute crap out of those group of people  as said on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m16s\">6:16</a><br><br>He said that no one assaulted women well look at the case of drawpati ( quiet ironical ) True and honest man 🙏😍 This man is pure gold❤️ This is what you have come with Hindu nationalist...then you haven&#39;t see left ecosystem extremist Difference between india and  Pakistan is India is secular.

But just to show their false superiority and ego, they are giving their rude gesture This is not Islamophobia, this is spread of Hindu phobia Modi 2024👍❤️❤️❤️ Fake news. Bible never tells to stone people who don&#39;t follow Christ m Jesus in fact, taught peace and love. His main teachings include<br>1.Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,<br>2. &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; <br>- Matthew 22:37-39<br> Please check facts before posting such misleading video. We never forcefully convert people. It&#39;s up to the individual to accept and change. Because there is &quot;life after death- eternal life&quot;. We preach the good news that there is life after death. It&#39;s up to the individual to accept Christ or not. God is watching over everyone. Those who forcefully do it or even making a propaganda, he will punish them. But, don&#39;t make the whole message of Christianity look bad for the deeds of few people. <br>Please understand the facts before posting such video Proud to be hindu You reap what you sow.

Iss se bada brainwashed chutiya shyad hi koi aur h india main ..taras ata h iske zindagi pe Christianity and Islam have nothing to do with India at all if not for Islamic Jihad and Christian Colonization by Foreigners who came to India, Lets be honest here. One emerged in Deserts of Saudi Arabia and other in Jerusalem, Both are 4000 - 4500 Kms away from India, Almost the same distance as Korea is from India.<br>\\r<br>Do you go telling Korean people about Hinduism or to accept Teachings of Vishnu ? No, They don&#39;t give a shit they would be like &quot;Fuck off mate&quot;. Same way Indians don&#39;t give a shit about Jesus or Muhammad, They are irrelevant to them and their Civilization. Christianity and Islam mean nothing to Hindus. So my question is -  Why force these Middle Eastern Cults on Hindus and make them live with these these Abrahamic Cultists who are trying every bit to spread their One God Madness in India ? indian nationalists pass stool Every claim is ryt. I can send u all the proofs. With chapters and verses Propaganda failed. better luck next time Jai jai shree ram 🚩 Phir apni beti ki bhi 5 shadiyan karana.😂😂😂 I am a Buddhist and your right THIS IS WHAT EVERY LOGICAL ALIVE HUMAN THINKS 11k dislikers are just LIBERALS AND MUSLIMS AND CHRISTAINS One Islamic mindset and Christian mindset अरे भाई इनके धर्म में ही jehad  लिखा हुआ  है,, ये जिसने कुरआन पढ़ी उससे हिंदुस्तान में रहने का कोई हक नहीं है।।। उनके लिए  14 aug 1947 में पकिस्तान बन चूका है।। Isiliye draupadi ko jua me bech diya aur uske sasur ke samne usko nanga kar diya ❤️ Cheap mindset, hindrance of knowledge<br>(RSS books says Christian and Muslims are internal threats to our nation.   but  having extremists nationalism and biased mind toward  one religion is actual threat) In a nutshell, it&#39;s okay to be a Hindu nationalist. bro we just need &quot;Bhagat Singh Wali Aazadi&quot;...true secular india...which will not support any religion...just respect the practice of every religion...but will not judge anything on tha basis of religion... Though I&#39;m a liberal. But i agree with some of his points. In my opinion all religions are useless and we should just focus on education and making our country better. Comment section full of Hindu extremists Hindu nationalism is required for hindus. ye bhai ko puri galti information hai about Quran <br>To clear all of your doubts about Quran <br>Number 1 sin the highest one is to kill or murder someone. <br>One of the sin is to force someone into Islam. <br><br>Bhai pata toh hai nahi kuch .. kuch bhi bake jaa raha hai.

So these xenophobic, ultranationalist r known as fascists and need to be decimated from gross root level as Nazis of Germany were decimated. Hitler was given some regard before his total demise similarly RSS and Modi, yogi would face same fate insha&#39;Allah. His knowledge on Christianity and Islam is so weak.

I&#39;m sure India&#39;s future is very dark due to this type of illiterate extremists. what is this video trying to prove cause i don’t think the guy is wrong 😂😂 A Muslim can&#39;t be perfect.<br>But Islam is perfect.<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/UiTSydIqNdA\">https://youtu.be/UiTSydIqNdA</a><br>This link is for those who think Islam says to kill non-muslims. Jai shree ram Based 🚩🚩🚩 If Pakistani Muslims who felt oppressed deserved a Muslim Nation, Hindus who feel oppressed today deserve a Hindu Nation. Hindus should never be apologetic about it. They should be worried about their own Future, Otherwise they will end up just like under Delhi Sultanate or Mughal Empire - Being Second Class Citizens in their own Homeland. <br><br>I would argue Hindus have not failed in upholding Secularism, It is Secularism that has failed in protecting Hindus and their aspirations in their own Homeland. In such a case, Throw away this Western concept of Secularism and embrace what India always was since 1000s of years  - A Glorious Hindu Nation. Rss keyboard warrior on comment box Bjp and rss is not about hinduism, their are all about terrorism and religious poison spreading and use hinduism as their face. Pure terrorism. He is right Every thing he told was true 😂😂😂😂😂😂 islam Aney se ladki cherne ka vichaar ayeh 😀😀😀😀😀 chutiyooooo.......😀😀😀😀😀 ...... Log ko encounter karein &quot;Constantine wrote the Bible?&quot;, wtf? Ok now do this with a islamic nationalist Kashmiri hindi and pakistan refugees are telling their stories that&#39;s all Mindset of Islam nationalist.... No you don&#39;t show I&#39;m neutral about this video, as in, you&#39;ve included &quot;liberal Muslims&quot; apologetics, very well knowing, majority mainstream Muslims not necessarily follow that. <br><br>I&#39;ve not liked/disliked the video, as it&#39;s containing apologetics for a particular religion. Mainly, I dislike, and, disagree, with this part specifically <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m47s\">2:47</a>; dhimmi system (after conquering land) is well known. &quot;Historical context&quot; is just apologia; rituals, and, tradition, aren&#39;t removed due to &quot;historical context&quot;, they&#39;re still followed, albeit with severe mental gymnastics, and, cognitive dissonance. <br><br>How am I to expect a left-wing influenced platform to not bring in apologia for defense, that was pretty obvious. I&#39;m a centrist, social democrat (with elements of capitalism, and, socialism), secular humanist, proponent of progressivism, atheist, and, effectively, an anti-theist. Ancient traditions (good parts) should be kept: caring for a fellow human being, being altruistic, etc. The bad parts should be opposed, and, discarded at all costs; I won&#39;t care. Bad parts include: the pointless mass slaughter of animals on Eid, Thanksgiving, Gadhimai, etc; believers Vs non-believers; internalised &quot;social credit score&quot; for certain societally accepted propositions; and the like. Also, I&#39;m opposed to Hindutva, Islamism, Zionism; the religious part should be scrapped out. They&#39;ve no relevance to modern society that embraces humanism, equalism, feminism, transhumanism, etc.<br><br>I&#39;d just end my note with a very special case of cognitive dissonance exuded by religious people, who claim &quot;we&#39;re reformed, and, liberal&quot;: <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ltey8BS83qSkd9M3u/a-parable-on-obsolete-ideologies\">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ltey8BS83qSkd9M3u/a-parable-on-obsolete-ideologies</a><br><br>If, and, only if, people valued humanity, and, animals. Not be a pathetic speciest. Not be a tribalist. Not be a proponent of casteism. Not be a proponent of sectarian divide (Islamic sect divide; Hinduism diversified divide; Christian sect divide; etc). Only if. If and only. Not gonna happen soon, but, people will value individual life more than community life. Jai shree ram Hey Such mindset is ruling India today. well.... v have a medicine for this jingoism which Ahmed Shah Abdali gave to marathas in panipat (from Islamic Republic of Pakistan) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m08s\">6:08</a> muslims ka kahan reservation hai be The person in the video is radical fundamentalist who can only pick a fight with a weak Muslim or Christian.<br>If he face stronger Muslim he would be punished and knocked down on the floor. Like it or not Abrahamic faith is more superior then Pagan Hinduism. Dont compress any Religion or any cast it will effect the whole world we will see soon that.... What a man....Great thoughts He is saying Quraan says stop the path os disbelievers, he is saying it out of context, these verses were for disbelievers of Arab who break an agreement that was made then, they attacked muslims at night at killed many which was against the agreement, so these verses were..<br>There is a story behind every verse of Quraan, don&#39;t say verses if you don&#39;t know the context of that verse Don&#39;t simply speak without knowing what u r saying Hinduism sucks False propaganda against hinduism and hindu nationalists... Its not so How come I don&#39;t find him evil.. he is right about what happened to Kashmiri pandits and Sikhs and how no one uttered a word This man is smarter than half of the left ecosystem <a href=\"https://youtu.be/puWvx4h1Go0\">https://youtu.be/puWvx4h1Go0</a> <b>He is not Hindu nationalist</b><br><b>He is Deshbhakt</b><br>❤️ <b>मै गांधी वादी नहीं हूं</b><br><b>मैं सुभाष चन्द्र बोस हूं</b><br>❤️ Proud of Him ❤ This is so much illogic and so much dirt.

The worst of things are done only by the best of the people When a Saraswati Shishu Mandir student from MP village makes more sense than Elite English medium student from Delhi you know your system isn&#39;t right My father was an immigrant from Bangaldesh. We were Zamindars there. Our house was set on fire, we were robbed several times. Last time my old great grandmother was beaten, grandfather was stabbed and we were left so penniless after the robbery that he didn&#39;t have the money to treat himself so put some ayurvedic leaves on the injury. My father flee for India couple years later. Despite having family and acres and acres of land he had to sleep in a rug with 20other people in a dorm and now worked his way up. Now he made several homes and made us engineers. It&#39;s funny when some senseless 16yr old watching Netflix who knows nothing of the outside real world talks about secularism. Our family have suffered bcz of this before and now I don&#39;t care communal or bhakt or whatever someone else say. My family and my religion will always be my preference and will do anything to save it Proud to be a Hindu Nationalist. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m50s\">2:50</a> these liberals are all liars Quran clearly states in 9 chapters that allah allows to kill all non muslim. The same Quran is read by terrorists in many extremist organisations like Isis,al Qaeda to train young kids .So the root cause of terrorism is Quran.

It is the most dangerous religion which brings only terrorist, terrorism, brutally killing of goats in their rituals. For the record the claims are not unsubstantiated. Although maybe he confused the stoning part with Christianity , I think it&#39;s an Islamic punishment. And it was indeed The Council of Nicaea which decided to make Christ the Son of God.

Therefore Hindutva cannot be dominating, because Hinduism is a victim of Aggression. \\r<br>\\r<br>Hindutva by its very nature cannot be agressive, because the very response to Hindutva emanated to be defensive.  \\r<br>Unless we examine and scrutinize the Abrahmic semitic faiths which by their very nature are proselytising &amp; predatory &amp; which by their very nature go the extent of negating other faiths as false faiths, then we must ask questions, should Hindus, should not come up with Intellectual, Political - Socio response to preserve and perpetuate the long lasting way of life.\\r<br>\\r<br>We can&#39;t accept\\r<br>the false equivalences drawn between two entities.\\r<br>1. &quot;La ilah illa Allah&quot;\\r<br> &quot;There is no God but Allah &quot;\\r<br>2. &quot;Jai Shree Raam&quot;\\r<br>&quot;Victory to Raam&quot;\\r<br>&quot;La ilah illa Allah&quot; is a negation of the existence of my God, However we won&#39;t negate other belief systems. \\r<br>\\r<br>Sir Sayyed Ahmed Khan in 1926, Hindus and Muslims are different Nations.\\r<br>\\r<br>&quot;It is a Shame to both the Hindus &amp; Muslamaans that the Hindus should have to run away from their homes as they have done, it is the shame for the Muslims because it is out of the fear of the Muslims that the Hindus have to run away from their homes, why Should a Human being inspire fear on other Human, My own experience but confirms the opinion that the Musalmaan as a rule is a bully and the Hindu as a rule is a coward&quot; Mahatma Gandhi after Noakhali Massacre. \\r<br>\\r<br>Writing Thoughts on Pakistan - Dr. B.R.Ambedkar.\\r<br>\\r<br>The Hindus and the Hindutva leaders whose primary ideology is defensive reaction towards aggression have been put in witness box as perpetrators of aggression. That has to change for always and for good times to come, we must be asking questions to those followers and leaders of Abrahamic faiths and we must put them to the same kind of scrutiny as put to the Hindu leaders. Does not your Religion at the very fundamental belief believe in dividing the World between believers and non believers? Is that not exclusivist? Unless we have intellectual strength to ask these fundamental questions we will be continuing to draw false equivalences and we will be treating the symptoms and not the disease itself. \\r<br>\\r<br>PS : As long as proselytising  Religions continue their existence as as Proselytising Religions Hindutva should be there to protect itself and not just protect itself but also protect the values that the Hindu society has perpetually held as sacred &amp; sacrosanct &amp; those values are in consonance to the modern secular values that Indian constitution so dearly upholds. U wanna surviving with your faiths. So, u choose hard-core nationalism against radical islamist supremacy..<br>From Greece This man is joker of India Even I&#39;m a pro hindu rastan but believe we should first conquer pakistan and Bangladesh then solve the internal issues Ask him about caste system 😂😂 Deuteronomy 13:6-10<br><br>“If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter or the wife you embrace or your friend who is as your own soul entices you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which neither you nor your fathers have known, some of the gods of the peoples who are around you, whether near you or far off from you, from the one end of the earth to the other, you shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you conceal him.

The bishops used to argue about what the rules were supposed to be and were kept in check by the Emperor. Mai ganrantee deta hu k ue Jhatu ko Aisa kuch Nahi bola gaya hoga Sab apne man ki baat karte hai bhadwe log Bilkul sahi baat hai👍 Well whether you agree or not the man had some facts up his sleeve, be it of the scriptures of history😅 I can clearly see through the intentions of &quot;Diplomat&quot;, trying to project him as oppressor and violent person. PAID MEDIA If he is the most extreme Hindu nationalist, you could find, then Hinduism has done a pretty good job of containing extremism Brother Iam a keralite christain..I have read bible a thousand times since my childhood and till now I did not see a single word about killing any humans who dosenot belieave in our religion..Christ only tell us to &quot;Love our Enemies&quot;.. someone please educate this lunatic Liberandus disliked it I&#39;m proud Hindu Nationalist.🙏🙏🙏 he didnt say anything wrong We don&#39;t have heats for hindus but heats for hindu gods.....!🤬🤬stupid You report whatever you wish too, but at least have learned people in your team who can do correct translations, many times the translation is wrong, most blatant and done with notorious intentions is at around 4 minute 40 second.  But congratulations, you found the religion of people easy to target. Jai Shree Ram 🧡<br>Jai Hindu Rashtra 🚩🚩 Jai hinduism he never read Bible or quran😂😂<br>bloody stupid But Christianity is very close to Hinduism we worship Jesus so why are you saying I hate Christianity baat sahi hai....agar sikh hindu jain ko kuch taqleef ho koi nahi bolta....agar ek bhi muslim ko kuch hua....saare secular wale aa jaate hai Afghanistan, pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia etc were hindus or bhuddist, where are they now?<br>Within India where are the Hindus of Kashmir, Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur? Coverted or killed? By Abrahamics religion? Andhbhakt 😑 clearly shows he is ANTI MUSLIM. Manu ka granth jake padho. Aur manuvadi savarn jo dalit logo ke sath karte hai .jo hindu religion me Untouchability practice ho rahi hai ,uske liye bhi bolo. Bhai .....mane humare akbar aur Jahangir bahut galti ....but religion ku abuse mat karo ...aap vedas aur Qur&#39;an pado...sachayi jaano ...aur unki laws kya hai ...aise half knowledgeable mein mat phasiyo bhai ... aapka creator ku jaano ...much love from india ❤️ Religious beliefs are for third world countries Sale tum log nadan ho tum jaanwar ka peshab pee lo gande bewkuf aadmi jhoote dhokebaaz from india You know they are intellectually inferior when they quote chapter 9 and then say Islam is violent.<br>FACEPALM. Couldn&#39;t agree more ❤️ If this is the mind set of hindu natalisnt...then he is misguided, does not know context to any of this saying. yeh log kalyug ke sabse bade rakshas hai..jo freedom of speech ka missue karte hai Pahle muze laga...ke ye bhi kattarvad ki bat karega..but he is real Hindu..sahe Kaha Bhai... What he said is truly correct . Count the killings in the name of Christianity and Islam  in the world history and killings even today because of it. Liberal muslims don&#39;t run the show. It&#39;s the fundamentalists  who follow true to the book and doesn&#39;t allow reinterpretation. 👌🙏✊ He doesn&#39;t have any problem with Cristin. But they have prblm with Christianity. <br>That mean i like human but i hate humanity. Lol Proud to be  right wing...and committed to hindutva This man  knows nothing. God may give him some intelligence. let me be sure... i am rajput and my grandfather migratd from india to pakistan in 1947. i think my grandfather was Right..... thanks god we are not in india.... and be sure we are coming again... Raja bhoj&#39;s palace has been destroyed by khilji and they have mounted the largest masjid in India 😠, just death to terrorism, bhopal was the hub of hinduism, it&#39;s not nawab&#39;s land Islam is a license to ear beef and to buy little girls 🤣 He is paid actor for this interview, not belong to RSS. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ccqUZi9Ze-0\">https://youtu.be/ccqUZi9Ze-0</a> Ola hu uber kaa baap it&#39;s really true    all he&#39;s saying is right I support the same ideology his thinking is tottaly bad its towards hate ..... infact in the current time each religious person has this kind of thinking only whether it is muslim hindu christian sikh ....we alll need to stopped this ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,different faiths people have to understand that we get live only for once so pls live it peacefully ...........all religions have to be libireal  specially muslims , christians and hindu , sikh too ..................... I am Hindu and Indian. Don&#39;t agree with this man. He said in the beginning that Christianity and Islam started problems in the world and then says Donald Trump and Vladamir Putin are famous because they arrested Muslim, they both are Chritstians too. But why does it even matter. We Hindus believe God takes a mortal form whenever the evil is more than the Good. Using this man&#39;s logic because Hindus don&#39;t have the majority of the population in the world. Hence, God would come and take care of it. You also talk about saving your God. But, how do you save that person who saves all of you? I&#39;m proud of my religion Hindu , but also think every religion is equal don&#39;t have problem with any religion problem with extremists of very religion especially Islam ..they think their god is only god and also it&#39;s more violent can&#39;t generalise buy bitter truth is whenever someone say there is terrorist attack everyone think about Islam that&#39;s how it is ..and also don&#39;t think christianism is violent many people in Europe are atheism who belong to Christian parents there&#39;s no such violent ..now here what&#39;s I don&#39;t like about Hinduism <br>.there is lot of introlence is increasing In Hinduism , <br>hinduism allow everyone to follow whatever they want , but nowadays people are threating someone  to say jai Shree ram this is worst thing ..it is becoming more like Islam ..they are beating to death to someone who even make slight fun ..this is getting more and more common Haath jode toh kam nahi ho rha🤣❤ Mandir ban gaya bro<br>Har jagah banega bro❤🕉<br>Hindu -sthan❤, 🤫 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/scbxuxmJ5hI\">https://youtu.be/scbxuxmJ5hI</a> see it dropadi k kitna patti tha?

I am a Hindu, and I respect this man one hundred percent.<br> This man is a Punjabi, he knows what his ancestors had to go through. Because of Islam, the Punjabi people (Hindus and Sikhs) had to flee their ancestral lands and leave everything what was native to them. Islam has done this to several other communities, not just communities in India.<br><br>Glad a Punjabi woke up about this issue, next I wish a Bengali with roots from Bangladesh should also do the same. Bilkul sahi baat boli h inhone ! Jai Jai Hindutva :) Sirf Hi9ndutva hi ye suar jaisa jihad se lad skta h ! He&#39;s amazing THIS MAN IS VERY COMPLICATED IN HIS OWN ... THEY ARE INHUMAN Even I am not a Gandhian.<br>I am Far Rightist. Such a fool, just claiming bullshit about stuff he does not even know Nice man Guys they are illiterates ...they think can glorify india by taking religion in their minds ....deep down we all know we can go ahead only when we&#39;ll accept that religion is a personal thing and has nothing to do with a country&#39;s development ... countrys develop only when people keep religion aside, work and explore the Edifice of science ......i think we shouldn&#39;t speak publicly about our religion or faith and even if someone does ..we should ignore him/her . ....the utmost pleasure comes in understanding the mind of the creator and not in fighting for the fake names and morals given in his name by filthy humans cope liberals What a Chad. 🧡🥺 I will support people like them for life. Jai shree ram I came to view a crazy radical - instead I listened to solid common sense - life is about survival and safeguarding culture. Saying all the claims this man made are wrong agreed.<br>Why do muslims and Christians always refer to manusmriti as if it is the only the only hindu text  <br>Why is rama called an invader in social text books in west bengal. I support this man all the data are made up by own and you see unsubstained claim on top then its ofc true just to promote<br>propoganda anti hindu propoganda they have made this video this is the pain of every peace loving person and true human. these Radicals in Islam and Christianity make we people angry from inside.

The channel just manipulated the like dislike section to give us a facade He is right If system can&#39;t be tackled using non-violence, it must be tackled using violence. No doubt in that. the thing is , there are 1.2billion people in India out of which 20 million are Muslims . Abe Lincoln once said, &quot;A house divided cannot function among itself&quot;. India could have dethroned China as the world&#39;s manufacturing hub if only our populous was united as Indians , But the reality is people consider themselves Hindu or Muslim first then Indian . I am a Hindu and  honest admirer / avid follower of PM Modi , he is doing some great thing , India is making staggering progress in automobile sector ,  but i completely and faithfully disagree with his &quot;Hindu First&quot; belief . Modiji is the only non corrupt PM India has ever had and i am proud of him but the way his political party potray Muslims is wrong and if India want to see growth in economy and international stature we must shed our Hindu Muslim tag and become Indian. I will also like to say that the great Subash Chandra Bose , marched his &quot;Azad Hind Fauj&quot; through Hitler&#39;s Germany chanting the slogan &quot;Hindu Muslim Sikh Essai apas mai hai bhai-bhai(Hindu Muslim Seikh Christian we all together are brothers)&quot;.  We are the countrymen of a great leader who literally punched Hilter square in his smug face , and rejected his ideology, I think we should thrive to be more like him . JAI HIND India is a Hindu land ...... This is how an educated right winger looks like. I support you 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 Librandu 🤣 ki ma ka bhosda Hindu 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡 Please make some videos on jnu&#39;s tukde tukde gang Gandu hai saala yeh Jo sahi h wahi kaha He is right Little knowledge is dangerous think What an illiterate mind.

Proud to be a hindu nationalist We need atheism in India Bhai tumne apni ved or gita nahi padi, bible our quran padh liya Worshiping Other Gods -Old Testament -Deuteronomy chapter 13<br>13 [a]If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a sign or wonder, 2 and if the sign or wonder spoken of takes place, and the prophet says, “Let us follow other gods” (gods you have not known) “and let us worship them,” 3 you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The Lord your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul. 4 It is the Lord your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him. 5 That prophet or dreamer must be put to death for inciting rebellion against the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery. That prophet or dreamer tried to turn you from the way the Lord your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you.<br><br>6 If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, 7 gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other), 8 do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. 9 You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. 10 Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. 11 Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one among you will do such an evil thing again. Nicely brainwash by RSS😂 . 33 crore devi aur deftha 😂. I am a proud hindu nationalist.

What an idiot He is actually right The word &quot;kafir&quot; means  the human who don&#39;t believe in Allah ,<br>if u don&#39;t like this word then accept islam and do believe in Allah 💥 So negative mind he has 😮<br>he have no clear knowledge of islam , <br>islam is a complete religion and a best way to live a life , This person don&#39;t have no 😂😂😂 logic at all Jai Hind. The mind of jihadists and these hindu nationalists  are very common.....they take over the weapons to kill normal people &quot;who don&#39;t chant allah or jai sri ram&quot; This mind is typical of rss or vhp or bjp ...people...but not all hindus. Rss believes in ideology of Mohammad Jinnah...&quot;muslims and hindus do not live together...they need a separate land&quot;.yet they are not called as  pakisthanis and anti nationals. Nazis had the same hate against Jews....and Jews are not Christians ...that is Zoroastrianism.... Jesus never say to kill anybody if one don&#39;t believe in him ....<br>This rss people have fed misconceptions in their minds from the school age itself ..so that can&#39;t see the truth... You seem to be Punjabi Khatri/Arora <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m52s\">3:52</a> why is it that Muslim majority countries are top on the list in religious violence uneducated freak. The day when we think, not as Hindus or Muslims or Christians or Sikhs but as Humans and Indians is the day when extremism, both right and left will finally end. Religion has killed more than 50 million lives in India alone. Do we need to establish a religious state? ab kitna bhi mindset check krte rho agle 20 saal tak toh mere bharat desh main yeh hi chalega dear the diplomate ..yeh toh liberal  hindu hai ..... asli hindu ka interview mat le lena galti se wo batayega ki hindu kya hota hai This guy is so dumb,  brainwashed by RSS in his school.

However That verse is proved wrong , Guys please don&#39;t be Mislead by all misinformation <br>You can refer <a href=\"http://quran.com/\">quran.com</a> for the same. 100 percent ri8 You are good There is no such Verse in the Bible, and the Bible was written by the disciples wich was inspired by God (holy spirit). The earliest writing of the Bible have been dated to 70 AD that is 35-40 years after Christ died. Constantine was the king of England who accepted Christianity. The fact that people criticize others for listening to a book written centuries ago when people had different ideas of ethics but then go on to follow their own religion without questioning its own ethics is something I can’t get my head behind.<br><br>I am speaking for people from all religions who generalize and villianify the other religious group The irony is religion was supposed to bring peace to the world Modi hai to Mumkin hai. He is quoting out of context from Quran The worst thing is he seems somewhat educated, or atleast literate. <b>If hating other religions makes me a Nationalist, then I am happy being a Human.</b> This guy is 100% right!!! Facts, this guy is spitting pure facts. बहुत बढीयां चचा. I am 100℅ with this man. But he is right what about that. True🔥 If after interviewing hundreds of &quot;Hindu extremists&quot; this is the &quot;worst&quot; you could get, then you have failed in your mission. 10k indian muslims disliked the video What he says makes sense... you are fake punjabi ,real sikh man doesn&#39;t give any bad statement about someone religion he truly respect all religions only 💜 How to properly beat your wife by Zakir naik<br>..<a href=\"https://youtu.be/RaVGn8VAczg\">https://youtu.be/RaVGn8VAczg</a><br>Regards:: a peaceful religion It&#39;s a reason people that read more, realize how ill informed they can be, even after all the reading they do. The man sounds &quot;know it all&quot;. It&#39;s understandable that True Hinduism doesn&#39;t get as many followers and so Hindu nationalistic sentiments feel the fear of getting destroyed. But then not even Hindus all agree or know what Hinduism is about. Only westerners with exploration in their nature, end up digging Hinduism. It&#39;s a sad fate of Hinduism that the followers now have to resort to madness. There were martyrs in Christian Religion. They died while preaching their faith. These blind Hindu Nationalist know nothing about their own faith. How will they teach it to others?

The editors of this video who wrote his claims to be unsubstantiated need to be smacked on their face.. India are 4th in religious violence yet have the nerves to talk about religious persecution in Bangladesh and Pakistan I don’t think that this guy said anything wrong Nothing wrong. 9.9k hindus nationalist disliked the video I am a proud HINDUTVA supporter. THERE ARE 30 MUSLIM COUNTRIES, 19 CHRISTIAN COUNTRIES, 7 BUDDHIST COUNTRIES, 1 JEWISH COUNTRY, but there isn&#39;t any country which is constitutionally Hindu Raşțra/ Hindu country. He is telling the truth.

This man has correct knowledge is totally correct this leftist and liberals will destroy india. Christianity and Islam came in 1st century AD onward.  Shudra have been there for 3000 years in India, with no dignity to live like equals. And it is Manusmriti sanctioned discrimination. These idol worshippers are beyond reason , War is inevitable , FREE KASHMIR Maybe he is a fake guy setup by the Diplomat company. The way he speaks, I smell agenda by the diplomat. Now go to a interview of a Muslim guy <br>Islam is cancer for humanity and for whole world. Fuck मुहम्मद... Fuck. अल्ला Pkmkb<br>👉 Fuckk islam<br>Fuck Christianity This guy blames everything on Islam and nothing on himself. He justifies using sticks to stop a traffic jam outside his house and claims Hindus are angry because there is a mosque on every road. The best bit is he blames rapes on Muslims because they created an atmosphere of teasing when they arrived in India so that history is to blame why women are raped in India today. And that my friend is hindu nationalism and a country run by a nazi leader produces idiots like this on mass. India is truly backwards in every sense. lIKE MILLIONS HE ALSO IS MENTALLY SICK BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA INFLICTED ON HIS FAMILY  DURING PARTITION THERE ARE LACS LIKE HIM IN INDIA INCLUDING POLITICIANS, BUREAUCRATS, BUSINESSMEN INCLUSIVE OF MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS HINDUS &amp; SIKHS WHO LIVE IN THE  MURKY PAST YET TRY TO GAIN A BETTER FUTURE, I THINK PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELLING IS NECESSARY FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY AS EVERYBODY HAS PERVERTED VIEWS WITHIN THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS ACCORDING TO THE ENVIRONMENT THEY WERE RAISED UP IN. MOST OF THE HATRED RAKED UP IN THIS COUNTRY IS BY PEOPLE DISPLACED DURING PARTITION, THEY WERE FROM A MUSLIM DOMINATED AREAS, THE PAKISTANIS ALSO SUFFER FROM THE SAME PSYCHE EXCEPT THE TRADITIONAL HINDUS FROM MAINLAND INDIA DO NOT BOTHER OF SUCH EXTREME VIEWS, NEITHER DO MUSLIMS AS BOTH HINDU AND MUSLIM FANATICS ARE DOING NOTHING BUT SPREADING HATE &amp; VIOLENCE  WHICH IS AS DANGEROUS TO THE COUNTRY AS DAESH, AL QAIDA  OR TALIBAN,  ILL INFORMED PEOPLE CAN BE MORE DANGEROUS TO SOCIETY AND THE COUNTRY AS RELIGIOUS POLITICIZATION  OR IDEOLOGISTS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A THREAT TO PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLD, WHETHER THEY WERE CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS HINDUS, BUDHISTS OR ANY OTHER CULTURE OR RELIGION LIKE ROME, GREECE, AZTECS, INCAS, PERSIANS.  MOST OF THESE RADICALS DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHO IS A HINDU, THE HINDU WORD WAS COINED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY BY COLONIAL RULERS, THE REALS WORD IS HIND THE LAND BEYOND THE HINDKHASH MOUNTAIN RANGE AND EUROPEANS CALLED IT  INDIE DUE TO PRONUNCIATION PROBLEM, THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A HINDU RELIGION IT WAS A WAY OF LIFE CULTURE AND DIALECTS THAT VARIED FROM REGION TO REGION IN INTERPRETATION OF RELIGIOUS TEXTS DURING COURSE OF TIME, THE INDIAN CULTURE IS LIKE A SPONGE THAT ABSORBS EVERYTHING AND GIVES ITS OWN INTERPRETATION OF SOCIETY OF INFLUENCES WHICH EMANATES FROM INSIDE THE SOCIETY OR FROM OUTSIDE. THE VARIATIONS ARE SO NUMEROUS THAT A DYNAMIC SOCIETY NEEDS BUT NO PLACE FOR VIOLENCE. NEEM HAKIM KHATRA E JAAN.

I am very inspired by watching this guy, unfolded truth by true nationalist.<br>Will sure join RSS India does have a problem of religious violence. But the number of instances of religious violence per capita is what counts.

It happened in Pakistan in 1947 during partition and democratic system of government give liberty to Muslims to to do their will just for votes not for next generations future and practically made lives impossible in a civil life.

Jahaliat tu hinuism na phela rakhi ba india ma jahil insan India ka future dikh rha hai jis tarah ye aadmi Bata RHA hai Apart from silly rude remarks here and there I found this person far more intelligent than Rahul gandhi. 😂 😂 😂 Islam is the only religion acceptable in the sight of Allah.<br>Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world not because of birth rate but because of people accepting islam. Before Islam came in India. People&#39;s are fired woman&#39;s after her husband death, marry with sister. So he have less knowledge about there religion and islam So why Islam is fastest growing religion on earth.

When the brain is washed with such hate uneducated &amp; even so called educated have the same understanding.<br> is the condition of Bechara sahi se dekh bhi nahi Santa k is k milk m Kiya ho raha hy I agree with the man on all his points but one: <br><br>He said that Christians and Muslims aren&#39;t his enemies but Islam and Christianity are. <br>Islam and christianity, have, with no doubt - violent and backward teachings, but the former chooses to act on these teachings and the later does not (at least not anymore). <br><br>The problem that Hindus are facing is, the culture of Muslims, not Islam itself. This racist man is talking shit. He needs an education. Lath utha kar pitai kardi mahashy ne Personally Petonally Poor guy told him about humanity . No no it’s all taken out of context we need to build bridge and say no to war plz plz plz Ask him about dalits also. These fucking RSS is only for hindus and here hindu means upper caste only. Dalits are not considered as Hindu. Have any hindu community wether it is rss, shiv sena, karni sena or bajrang dal ever tried to stop the discrimination against dalits? No never. And they say that they are saving hindus from muslims. They hate us so much that they can give their girls to muslims but not dalits. Islam k bare yeh kya janta h are pagal insan islam hi ek ayesa mazhab h jo aurath ko barabar ka hissa diya aur uski izzathh karna sikhaya tum bhakth kya jano He don&#39;t have complete knowledge.

Its very clear Muslim of India need a separate land soon or later. <br>Because to survive in India with Hindu radical and extremist mind set is impossible for Muslims and other minorities. Secular parties are biggest criminal and communal. He is truly an articulate person.<br>He is honest. good fellow . may be some mistakes . nonviolent . hindu India get wrong ways RRS and BJP are modelled on the nazis. Putin visited the biggest mosque in moscow he also said islam is a part of russian history. India is the 2nd biggest beef exporter in the world. Hindu nationalists are facists. This is what happens when you defecate in the open while eating paan. Google ghazwa e hind and u will get your answers. All this hindu extremest is on rise and it will continue rising until there is a huge war between Hindus and Muslims. At first Hindus will win and even take control some parts of Pakistan but that will be short lived and there will be another war,  this time tables will change as Muslims from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran will join and recapture whole of India. This is called ghazwa e hind. Educate yourself fools This is the product of minority appeasement har govt.

The BJP should consider education if they want to uplift the lives of poor people in india.I strongly believe this kind of indoctrination would not put india forward in anyway. This guy need mental asylum just spreading venom againat Hindu Muslim brotherhood and their sweet relationship The BJP IS the political wing of RSS, Rss founded in 1925 inspired by mosolini and consider hitler there hero and also believe that Hindu are the real master race Try looking into the mind of<br>1.

Modi bhakt I wonder why was the diplomat not bothered to write &#39;unsustainable claim&#39; when the Quran&#39;s chapter was misinterpreted. The reading of Al-Tauba (chapter 9) is completely unsustainable, baseless and read out of context.

Read bible nicely then understand it rascal you may god yourself and worship them stupid Shame on india This is completely scripted and a clear Hindu propaganda!! Deutoronomy 13:6-9 in the Old Testament is where Death to Apostates is mentioned. This guy is being hated on for lacking political correctness and for calling a spade, a spade. For all the communal people, go to schools run by Hindu nationalists. You will see how they treat Muslim and Christian students. See the social service they do to people of all religions. And no, they do not shamelessly ask people of other religions to convert like Mother Teresa. (no offence to her followers, but I have seen first hand the way she poked second hand needles into poor people) Sure, there are fringe groups but the government cracks down on them and severely condemns them. No illegal hate mongering is tolerated in our country against any religion. We as a country definitely do not mis-treat minorities or disrespect their beliefs . It is the other way round. Just like Mr Bhatia, all my four grandparents were from Bangladesh. We were not dealt with very tolerantly as a minority. We were forced to leave and after the 1965 Indo Pak War have been unable to see our own properties. They have been demolished by the people out there. For two to three decades, after 1947, our family struggled for two square meals a day. (till my parents got high paying jobs themselves)<br>I, for one, despite being a proud Hindu, do not hate muslims, christians , jews or people of any religious group. I have friends from all groups. I believe that all rivers lead to the same ocean and that the core values of any religion is the same. It is the texts and the upper class of the society that have maligned them, so as to control and fool the poor people into submission. Even Hinduism , for instance, never supported the caste system. Opportunistic upper class chauvinists in the society introduced it. If you looks at the Ramayana, for instance, the antagonist , Ravan, was an Agnihotri Brahmin. The protagonist, Shree Ram, was a Kshatriya.(a lower caste compared to Brahmins). The other protagonist, Lord Ram&#39;s devotee, Hanumanji, was of an even lower caste (some tribal caste). Even the original Vedic scriptures have no mention of caste discrimination. The bad sides of every religion today are a result of the ruling and administrative classes tweaking the texts to their own convenience to control and exploit the lower classes of the society. Arey bhai pehle tu apne vaid toh padh le usme bhi saaf likha hai multi pooja pap hai aur quran ki baat kar raha hai @The Diplomat we dont need ur help for understanding my country . I very well know how you can divide people just by spreading fake news 🤣😂🤣😂 great Quran me likha ha Maro ........<br>Ar jab hamari baat nhi suni jati   ham hathiar uthate Haan....kabhi ghut bandhna padhta ha..kabhi khud ka chup nhi pata If ur religion compell u to hate ....then change ur religion... very important for indians Idiots... I swear to GOD i never like to use this word but i will use to say you Guy&#39;s are stupid out of stupid😠😈 there are many God&#39;s but no one died like Jesus for the sake of humanity... This man is speaking his own words.....&quot;Big mouth&quot;..... wrong quotations from koran out of context. I want India to unite but I don&#39;t see how, there is too much hate in us both Hindus and Muslims here are to blame, dono side hi ek se bar Kar ek chutiya giri kartein hain. HAHAHAHA...he says Eve teasing started after Islam came....oooffff, i hv nothing left to say....🤣🤣 At 2.00,he is talking about Surah Taubah chap 9 of Holy Quran, if any literate person who knows english literature well, i tell read chap 9,if u r Sensible  ,u will understand the real meaning of that chapter.......its context, dont spread corrupt knowledge of the Book, its very sad....<br>Dont jump to conclusion, if u r not understanding, then ask the scholar.......otherwise, be happy with false knowledge........<br><br>U hv directly read chap 9 of Quran, why u skip 1st 8 chapters??read from starting  n grasp  also, u cannot understand any subject by reading from middle chapters.........<br><br>WISE WILL UNDERSTAND MY WORDS... Bhai tu rss wala Hai.<br>Tu Godse ka bhakt Hai.<br>Or abhe tujhi na to hindu dharm ke jankary Hai or nahe or dusro dharm ke So it has proved that a kaafir can only misunderstand Quran....because he never wants to clarify misconceptions.

Islam is only way to enter heaven else enter hell eternally.यह आपकी गलती नहीं है, आप गलत हैं क्योंकि आप सच्चाई से अवगत नहीं हैं। इस्लाम केवल स्वर्ग में प्रवेश करने का एकमात्र तरीका है और नरक में अनंत काल तक प्रवेश करता है।તે તમારી ભૂલ નથી, તમે ખોટા છો કારણ કે તમે સત્યથી પરિચિત નથી. ઇસ્લામ સ્વર્ગમાં પ્રવેશવાનો એકમાત્ર રસ્તો છે અને શાશ્વત રીતે નરકમાં પ્રવેશો.یہ تمہاری غلطی نہیں ہے، آپ غلط ہیں کیونکہ آپ حقیقت سے واقف نہیں ہیں. اسلام جنت میں داخل ہونے کا واحد راستہ ہے اور ہمیشہ ہمیشہ جہنم میں داخل ہوتا ہے.ليس خطأك ، أنت مخطئ لأنك لست على علم بالحقيقة. الإسلام هو السبيل الوحيد لدخول الجنة وإلا يدخل الجحيم إلى الأبد.ಇದು ನಿಮ್ಮ ತಪ್ಪಲ್ಲ, ನೀವು ಸತ್ಯದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ತಿಳಿದಿಲ್ಲದ ಕಾರಣ ನೀವು ತಪ್ಪು. ಇಸ್ಲಾಂ ಧರ್ಮವು ಸ್ವರ್ಗಕ್ಕೆ ಪ್ರವೇಶಿಸುವ ಏಕೈಕ ಮಾರ್ಗವಾಗಿದೆ, ಇಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೆ ಶಾಶ್ವತವಾಗಿ ನರಕವನ್ನು ಪ್ರವೇಶಿಸುತ್ತದೆ. My non muslim brothers and sisters, please read your scriptures and Quran, you will come to know who is our Lord.<br>मेरे गैर मुस्लिम भाइयों और बहनों, कृपया अपने शास्त्रों और कुरान को पढ़ें, आपको पता चल जाएगा कि हमारा भगवान कौन है।<br><br>إخواني وأخواتي من غير المسلمين ، يرجى قراءة كتابك المقدس والقرآن ، وسوف تعرف من هو ربنا.<br>میرے غیر مسلم بھائیوں اور بہنوں کو براہ کرم اپنی صحیفیات اور قرآن پڑھئۓ، آپ کو معلوم ہو گا کہ ہمارے رب کون ہے.<br>ನನ್ನ ಮುಸ್ಲಿಮೇತರ ಸಹೋದರ ಸಹೋದರಿಯರೇ, ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ನಿಮ್ಮ ಧರ್ಮಗ್ರಂಥಗಳನ್ನು ಮತ್ತು ಕುರಾನ್ ಅನ್ನು ಓದಿ, ನಮ್ಮ ಕರ್ತನು ಯಾರೆಂದು ನಿಮಗೆ ತಿಳಿಯುತ್ತದೆ.

Itni nafrat He right about the verses in quran. Islam is violent No such things are written in Bible 🤣🤣 Ure fucking brain wash by RSS Satya Sanatan sarvada hi Jai I want to ask this guy that wen he is saying Bhagwan ram and guru gobind Singh said that if it doesn&#39;t work with ur words then use weapons.. To explain his religious  intolerance den why is he quoting the bible n the Qura&#39;n to create a bad perspective bout it??? (in the Qura&#39;n to kill is mentioned only at the time of war) That means ur books also talk bout killing other ppl...These guys have no tolerance that means wen u can beat up a taxi driver n take the law in ur hands I think  dats a little thing... While he addresses the rajasthan killing as &quot;only one killing  or life taken.. He has a pathetic mindset. Shameless pathetic mindset. If Muslims do this to muslim or non muslim. We will never stand or protect such ppl...<br>He is only using verses of the Qura&#39;n n the bible that he can use against the religion to prove his correctness..This is absolutely disgusting.. May b you don&#39;t know mister women in Islam has the highest ranks.. You were the ones who were burning women in fire alive wen her husband died.. In islam women has the right to choose her spouse..Muslims can be wrong they can project wrong islam n dat can be the case in ur religion too.  The bottom line is religion was never the matter n Hinduism doesn&#39;t teach such things n neither do other religions..  So stop discriminating n dividing ppl. Wow he is blaming eve teasing also on Islam... he is the crappiest guy I have ever seen.

It has changed a lot now... <b>This guy is the voice of every common Indian, and he might have made some mistakes, but he is speaking the truth. India has suffered greatly at the hands of these foreign occupiers, and there&#39;s still no end to it. Look at what happened in Malda, Kairana and is still happening in Kashmir today. India has paid enough price for this one sided secularism. We need to wake up before Kashmir model is replicated in other parts of India.</b><br><br><b>The diplomat, why don&#39;t you do a &quot;mind of a muslim extremist&quot; next time?

No far from time when muslim and hindu will kill eachother and no one will be left to worship anyone. Wt a time when human is afraid of human instead of animal and ghost. Pure World Ko Ek Hona Padega Is Chuslam Ke Liye Isko Jad Se Khtm Krna Padega Is Kom Ne Insaniyat Khtm Krdi Hai Bbc wale 🤨 Baat to theek ki bhai ne Replying to those who&#39;re saying that India is a secular country dr. Ambedkar said so. Well, Dr. Ambedkar wasn&#39;t the father of this nation (Neither was Mahatma Gandhi) He was just a person who compiled all the written constitutions of the world in the most distraught form. Now, moving on to the next thing being saidp, Believe it or not, if this country has to survive long enough, it needs hindu majority, thats the only case, because (sadly) they are the only one who are divided into different castes, so they cant be one, never. Hence, no chances of a major uprising against any community. Now, if it ever had muslim or Christian majority, then we all know what its gonna do. Lets just look at some facts:- Kashmir, Kerala, Western and southern U.P.. three states and the most violent areas of India, and whats does it have in common - Uneducated Muslim majority. So. Just dont play secular card everywhere, I for one only supports what the actual practical condition says. And, who am i? My name is Ankit, and I&#39;ve been working for women&#39;s welfare in muslim dominant areas (So basically working for muslim womens) You dont always need to be so called secular to do the right thing, Hinduism taught us to help everyone in need. Hindu agar quran dil se pdh le, to muslim ban jayenge, ye aadmi mislead kr rha hai, main saare hindu bhai ko bolta hai, pls dil aur dimag kholke, ek baar quran zarur pdhna, allah aaplogo ko hidayat dega. He is just a HINDU not a nationalist. &quot;If you real brother doesn&#39;t believe in Christianity, then stone him to death&quot;??????????<br>WTF  STOP SPREADING LIES!!!! Joota Gila karo aur Maro apne mooh pe Constantine didn&#39;t write the Bible.  The bible wasn&#39;t even a thing until the 1300s when they removed the apocalypse of Peter, to be later known as, &quot;Dante Alghieri&#39;s Divine Comedy&quot;..<br> <br>The council of Nicea was when The Roman Empire/ Church, after killing off the original followers or Eashoa; canonized what was to become the liturgy of the mass. No one was allowed to read it much less own a copy of it.

He&#39;ll be clueless He is so wrong about bible &amp; Christianity  ... Its foundation is non violence bro ... This person is dead on Education might change everything !! You’re not a Gandhibadi, you don’t love non-violence, dear Nationalist. But now take this- if you’re not a Naturalist first, then you can never be a Nationalist, forget about your involvement in religion. No pure religion teaches Violence. After-all, Gandhi Ji is a legend and you’re not, poor human! A rich human is one who loves all religion and never speaks bad about any religion. A pure human is one, who always appreciates the good of anything and ignores the bad. A rational human is one who uses his own brain rather than blindly believing in ideologies of a million different minds. Get your stability, dear follower. Get yourself dressed first, then get educated and not over-informed to crash into bunkers. Never spread hatred, spread love. Take examples from all religion. Pick the lovers, not the haters. I doubt you behave well with people. People like you don’t see the heart of a human first, all you try to see about a stranger is- the religion... Be a human first, then talk in front of the camera like a celebrity. Islamophobia Ja kay DNA test kervale yaar.... <br>Sirf aurat ko sati ke naam pe jalaya jata tha.... Wht ever he say is incorrect.... Kuch bhi 😂 This guy was really honest😂 I am feeling  depressed by listening this Brother views because if we want to read maths or science in our school time  we have specialised teachers for that .<br>   But when we go to read religious scriptures by ourselves this is not fair .if we need to understand the this worldly education we need a teacher ,how it&#39;s is fair we read religious scriptures by ourselves and molde their according to our choice. This is not fair . similarly we need a teacher who helps us to understand the real meaning of religious scriptures I think I should report your channel I support this man Brainwashed idiot . Now I can totally agree with the facts that says RSS and BJP provokes terrorism and that&#39;s  why they hate mahatma Gandhi Inhone konsi awaz utha li Kashmir k liye ye bc sab apni Roti paka rhe hai. Bhosre wale larkiyo ka sab sai zyada rape India mai hota hai or rape krne Wala chutye Hindu hota hai bhosre wale <b>Quran(98:6)</b> - Indeed, they who disbelieve(In Islam ) among the People of the Scripture(Jews and christians) and the polytheists(idolators or al mushriq) will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein.

Masjids are being made by Muslims community itself, not by the funds of the government. Just go through the punishment for harassment according to Islam and then say whether Islam promotes harassment or not. Muslim&#39;s are best So people of India want that we Muslim should leave the country. As we are not the citizen of India brainwash already has been done.....god save this country This is Hindustan.. I REPEAT HINDUSTAN... So get the Idea..  Is Pakistan a secular country.. Then why should we be... Atheism is the best policy! He said the truth You know people aren&#39;t as dumb as you think them to be...you no longer have the power to misguide people in the wrong direction. This gentleman here makes absolute sense and your misrepresentation of everything he says really shows how low you&#39;ve fallen :) Somebody please show him to a psychiatrist. He needs treatment immediately. You people need to understand the difference between civic nationalism and ethnic nationalism. Btw, Muslims call Christians polytheists as well. Jesus Christ even stopped a stoning...what is this fool talking about? The Christian scriptures DO NOT call for stoning people...this is obvious by the fact that he can&#39;t reference his claim. Christians have NEVER followed Old Testament Hebrew Law as such. The first Christian Martyr was Saint Steven who was stoned to death by JEWS...NOT CHRISTIANS. If you don&#39;t know the Christian scriptures please shut-up. LIES....the Christian bible doesn&#39;t say to stone a real brother who rejects Christianity. I dare anyone to prove it. Chapter and verse please! This troublemaker thinks he can lie and get away with it. This man is a LIAR!

This man is blind bhakt doent know fuckall about Islam and Christanity and chatting shit, look into ur own religion first how much hatred you lot got between each other case upper and lower caste etc. First solve ur own religion shit issues and then focus about other religion. chutiyo ki fauz Perception overall unsubstantial.... True representation of India. Faith and belief may make a human extremist, even muslim, hindu or christian, because faith make your mind that you r on the right way while others r not. Very sympathetic guy...I really feel for him and the people behind his pathetic belief. May the good Lord and the son and holy spirit show him the way ...my prayer for him from the heart Agar Islam me itna voilance hai toh Phir kyun world approx 60 Muslim country hai, aur world&#39;s 2nd biggest religion. And worlds fastest growing religion. Samjho mere dost Islam ko padho aur samjho If many people think like him, this country will end up in the dumpster This man is totally foolish... Islam is a threat to humanity He is absolutely correct......

How dirty, they are? keep india hindu Bhai jhoot bol kar nafarat kiu falara hai ho 😜🥴 Sahi Bola bhai. The subtitles in this video are totally wrong. brain washed by gau rakshak U are a FUCKER a saitan person भाई बाइबिल में कहा लिखा है कि काफ़िर को ईसाई बनाओ नहीं तो पत्थर से मार दो। भाई आप बिलकुल गलत हो। बाइबिल में येशु मसीह ने कहा है मत्ती रचित सुसमाचार में कि &quot; तुम अपने दुश्मनों के लिए दुआ करो । &quot; अपने दुश्मन से भी प्यार करो। &quot; फिर आपने कौन सा बाइबिल पढ़ लिया ??? हिंदु धर्मग्रंथों में भी बहुत बार हिंसा की बात आती है। लेकिन बाइबिल एक मात्र परमेश्वर के पुत्र येशू की बलिदान की प्रेम की गाथा है। नहीं विश्वास तो आप एक बार  बाइबल पढ़ के देख लो। How does corruption mean secularism. Honestly people who think that a certain sect of people are superior without any proven context is terrorism. Regardless the the terrorist is muslim, hindu or Christian. Those who think the subtitles were biased, it was just giving the appropriate facts. Think about where this man who was brought up RSS, where would he get his facts. But India should respect every type of people, even people like this man and people of other religions. Well i don&#39;t know what&#39;s the problem in not bothering other people&#39;s business, grow up fellow indians. Let&#39;s develop. Let&#39;s bring education. Let&#39;s bring money.

Who killed Mahatma Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi ???? Brother do you know more than 50 lacs non-muslim indians working in islamic country (Gulf), are they all force to say Allahu Akbar or were they forced to accept islam? brother please do not spread hatred. muslims says worship one god, thats what written in hindu scriptures, brother please read your vedas, upanishad, rigved, chaturved and if you are true believer then follow your scripture sir non-muslims main kuch mis-conception hai islam ke liye, bhai ne kuch reference diya quran se, sir aap surah taubah aayat puri  pade translation ke saath, agar islam main kisi non muslim ko by force muslim banana  hota to mugal ne takreeban 800 saal rule kia, unke liye to bahut aasan tha, aur secondly agar hindu bhai unki apne ved or religious book read kare to unko bahut saari similarity milegi, bhai ne kaha islam se pehle ladkiyon ko cheda nahi jaata, bhai islam se pehle ladki paida hote hi zinda dafan kar diya jaata, islam ne isko khatam kiya, Stop spreading wrong message there is no where written in Quran to kill some one ,in fact it&#39;s written &#39;if u r killing a human as if u r killing whole himanity &#39; people lyk this who doesn&#39;t have full knowledge gives wrong msg ,I challenge in his lyf he hav never opened quran n read that verse may b heard it from some one there soo called sar sangh chalaks who r anti muslims who wans to finish Islam ,I wan to tell them tum kaunsi khet ki mooli ho aise aise badshah chalegaye hamey mitatey mitatey for an example genghis khan many more ,jis tarah hamle kiya jaara hai muslamano pe agar koi aur religion hota toh ab tak uski hasti mit chuki hoti,Allah ne vaada kia hai tum humko maarogey toh Allah tumharey beech mein SE hi kisko hidayat dega aur woh dushmano ke khilaaf khada hoga Islam ke saath yeh b padhlo Uneducated person with brain wash by rss So much hatred and violent thoughts is putin an anti-muslim guy? <br>didn’t know! We have nothing against Muslims but we do have it against Islam Its sad to see that religion  is divining the whole human race now whereas its supposed to spread peace and unity. Brainwash ho chuka hai launde ka The comments section is sad. please read from quran sure al kaferun with hindi translation then u know everything A bucket of sympathy for him Never heard a guy speaking things that&#39;s in my head. Well said brother. Waah sir islaam aane se phle ladkiyo ko chedha nahi jaata tha?<br>Sir, Apke pyaare kishan kanhaiya bhi toh ladkiya chedhte the,<br>Apke RAAVAN ne bhi Sita haran kiya tha,<br>Draupadi ka bhi cheer haran mahabharat ke samay me hua tha.<br><br>I am not a muslim btw. Well said bro Islam is the most peaceful religion, Yeh ashanti failaane wale toh sirf or sirf BJP nd RSS<br>And 2nd thing Islam, Christianity, Judaism<br>Three of religions are having same origin our for father Prophet Ibrahim AS(PBUH).<br>And the other thing, who said Islam sirf 1400 years phle aaya, usse phle bhi jab jab prophets aaye duniya me, sabhi ne yeh kaha ek Allah ki upaasna kro, wohi paalne wala h, wohi maarne wala h, aur hum saare prophets pr Imaan rakhte hain aur Prophet Muhammad SAW (PBUH) was the last prophet jinhone bhi yahi seekh di.<br><br>And also google the most Influential people on the earth ,the very first name you&#39;ll see Prophet Muhammad SAW (PBUH) He reminds me of Nazis, they had the same thoughts about Jews in Germany. Best one.... &quot;Liberal Muslims say the verses quoted from the Quran here do not encourage violence if interpreted in the context which existed at the time of their writing&quot;<br><br>So you base your facts on apologetics? This claim of &#39;out of context&#39; has been exposed several times...by scholars, ex muslims and christians. I have read the quran. First of all there&#39;s no context to begin with. Second, the verses do encourage violence whether you like it or not. Facts do not care for your feelings nor secularism. Most modern apologetics try their best to make some other meanings out of those verses. But they forget the fact that those verses have already been explained by the prophet himself and the hadiths. Also, the verses have been explained word by word. The apologetics can indoctrinate the gullible Mozlems of India who cant even translate a simple arabic sentence. But they cannot fool ex-muslims from Arabia.<br><br>I stopped watching the video there because the moment i read the above mentioned sentence, i understood that the supposed media channel is trying to demonize hindus and present islam as something which is completely different from what this man is saying.<br><br>The guy is completely right about most of the things. I&#39;m not sure about christianity though He is entitled to his opinion.<br>But relegion.. regardless of which one has caused violence, You kill a thousand or you kill one. It&#39;s still murder. India is at a violent phase now. Such to bola Filled with dung islam nd Christianity are dangerous for humankind ! Kahan se aate h aise chutiye Epitome of Ignorance and Moronic Sense Even Hinduism contained many flaws like sati and widdows restrictions but Hinduism was reformed by reformers like RR Roy. Other religions should be also reformed.Peace is the best religion He needs proper education. Shi bola bhai ne musalan jaha hote hai waha gand failate hai sale He is telling what he observed, heard and understood about the society near him. He seems quite honest and straight forward, nothing wrong with that. This man is 100% right One woman married five man&#39;s 😅😂 Now make same video on Muslim.. than u can see difference btwn them... N btw he is not Hindu.... Coz I have lot of Hindus friend and this is something shit This guy is straightforward and he is telling the truth...Too much appeasement will certainly infuriate the majority people <a href=\"https://youtu.be/shVh3OKKsjk\">https://youtu.be/shVh3OKKsjk</a> You r a knowledgeable man.... &quot;&quot;Jio Or Jine Do&quot;&quot; Bukhari Volume 5, Book 59, Number 512: \\r<br>\\r<br>Narrated Anas:\\r<br>The Prophet had their men killed, their offspring and woman taken as captives.

Joooth bol tha saale tere khy malum .<br>Tu decided kare gaa <br>K log kisa soche . नया नस्ल का  आयाम?<br>यह नस्ल देश को बर्बाद करेगा। The video made by u is bullshit and wants to show Hindus in low light ........ shame on you Oh my God this guy is full of shit. All his quotes from the Bible and Quran aren&#39;t true at all. He should sit down with a Christian and a Muslim and then have a proper debate let&#39;s see how far will he get. What a moron he was in this video. Shame on him. Pathetic! Aesa log Ghar sa bhagay huay hotay Hain Inko koi nhi puchta I dont wanna comment to any gawar poisons like him anyway.... This guys is totally true hard off bro strongly agree I&#39;m an Indian and I must say manusmriti is the reason behind plight of women not Islam. The diplomat you just took interview to make him feel like he is wrong . You could just make your own video . You took his feelings and believes and expressing your own views and telling he is wrong. नाजी का सोच भी इसी तरह का बन गया था। सन 1945 आते-आते ज्यादातर जवान जंग में मारे गए थे.... 15-16 साल के लड़कों को जंग में भेजा जा रहा था। हम लोगो को बस दुवा करनी चाहिए कि कोई इतिहास भारत मे ना दुहराई जाए। Bible Acha padlo yarr,Bible me yesa kaye nahi likha he Video maker tum chutiya ho .......uske kahe gye baat pe tum apne hisab se subtitles laga ke apni ghinouni soche viewer&#39;s me poucha rahe ho.......so pathetic Doropati ko duryodhan or dushaasan ne cheda tha lagta hai inhone Ramayana nahi padha Achah abaa tumare ram bawa.

With population of almost 80% Hindus, India was still ruled by Muslims for 1000 years, less in numbers but still fucking mother India..... But still in ur fucking India, conversion to Islam is highest..... This capital C guy seems very frustrated. He just trying to be popular even he has lack of knowledge. Hindu Muslim se phele ek insaan bnana sikho bhaiyo ek insaan hi insaan ke kam ayega Luv u bro Aisi soch Desh ke liye acchi nai ..Desh Ki takat Hamari Diversity mai hai diversion mai nai . Actually Bjp/RSS wants that all those who are abroad in US should return back to India,thats why these thugs are employed to put fear in Christians who are living in peace and harmony with other religions... BJP&#39;/RSS is dividing and ruling India . Angela Markel ka example dera hai? Saale usne hi Syria and Iraq k 80K plus refugees ko apni country me lia, zindagi me kabhi ye mat boldiyo k angela markel anti muslim image ki vajah se famous hai vaha k log Indian bhakts jaise chutiye nhi hai First find real scholar and ask him the meaning of those line in surah tawba..what that means..<br>Then you will understand and believe that Islam is religion of peace.. <br><br>I can also tell you but hate to write long comments, also not that good in English.. He said came from Pakistan thts why his mind is like them dalit killed by muslim n christian. Khuch bhi kro kuch bhi bolo aur baad me bharat mata ki jai aur jai shree ram boldo sb shi ho jayega😂.....ladkyon ko dabana chedna salon Post Vedic time se hai jaker dekh history chodu sala.... nationa ke liye kuch na kiya ho pr nationalism ka kapda pahn kr nachenge chutiye. Comment section is the future of India.  Modi-Sabka saath Sabka vikas Sabka vishwas Thank God that this guy spoke the truth about the religion of satan, Islam. I support him 100% and hope everyone in India takes pride in their culture and knows the true face of these islamist bastards. App ke mutabik eve teasing islam ke badd aayi tho ravan ke barre mai kyaa kahooge.  Adhuraa gyan leke sirf hatred speech or poison niklee ga. Or rahi batt kafir ki kafir matlab jo religioun ko na mantaa hoo. Galat kamm kartaa hoo. Tho  bahi app tho religion ko  mantey hoo . Bakaiti kr raha hai.. aisi radical budhdhi auro ki bhi ho gai to? canada saare sikhs ko nikal dega. US -UK saare hindus ko nikal denge. UAE jinhe wo hindi muslims bolta hai, unhe nikal denge.. wah kya solution hai! Inki soch to dekho.. thailand tk akhand bharat banayenge.. pashu ko mata bana rakha hai. Abe doodh to bakri ka bhi peete ho. &quot;Gandhi ko nahi manta&quot; .. gaddar savarkar ki photo laga ke ghoom noto pe!  <br><br>See, although I am not sure about the existence of god.., but if there&#39;s any, then he is just the supreme energy for the cosmic world, nothing else. He is surely weaker then the Time which is continously changing. Don&#39;t get trapped.. with such poisonous mindsets. For rest others...  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Jvv8SK66_Eo\">https://youtu.be/Jvv8SK66_Eo</a> Person (dumb) like this gives meaning of verses of quran and bible even though he don&#39;t understand Arabic nor English in which both the holy books are written. There is a ancient famous saying - &#39;Khali dimaag shaitan ka ghar&#39; which fits him the best.<br>He didn&#39;t even know the history and telling infront of media about ancient conditions.<br> where does this kind of extra-education morons comes from...! MAHAPUNJAB Its very sad how his parents made him think this by feeding him shit i as a Muslim living in pakistan having hindu friends meeting their families that none of them were given options such as leaving their relegion or going against it we as muslims respect other minorities and communities and our hindu brothers should do the same.. Sati to india mei hi tha.  Dalit ladies ko oopar kapde pehenna allowed nahi tha aur unke saath koi bhi oonchi jaati ka aadmi sex kar sakta tha...  Untouchability bohot zyada thi...  Islam ne to roka nahi hai aurat ko padhne se logon ne roka hai bass... Aur saudi Arabia mei to koi nahi chedhta aurat ko...  Aur muslims to bilkul nahi chedte ladkiyan... I am sorry to say...  But this man says he knows instead he knows not...  Surah at taubah was revealed at the time of war...  Whenever it says in surah at taubah to kill a disbeliever whereever you see them...  It is written in context of war.. When the disbelievers deliberately wanted to erase the idea of islam by killing all muslims for no reason...  So at that point the muslims had to fight...  According to islam...  Jihad is something you do when someone has wronged you or not allowed you to practice your religion or not allowed you to preach that God is one...  Islam is against killing innocent human beings and I can say this by quoting a verse which says...  Killing an innocent man is as if you have killed the whole of humanity and saving a life is as if you have saved the whole of humanity.  And also in another surah it says that, &quot;So o disbelievers say that you shall not believe what I believe and I shall not believe what you believe and you shall be on your path and I shall be on mine&quot;. Basically Islam tells us to preach and if someone does not want to listen then let them go... God has given everyone free will and that is the concept of Islam.  I think this man has been brain washed by RSS. And also....  Islam is against invasion...  It has completely prohibited invasion...  Whoever invades in the name of Islam is not a muslims...  Like even Babar was not following Islam when he invaded India. There is no such thing written in bible Aisi nafrat bhari vichardhara, jiska thikana saraswati shishu mandir h,<br>Hadd h yaar<br>Bachcho ko pyar se rahne k bajaaye nafrat ka beej bo rahe h<br>Really shameful Insan or janwar kese barabar ho skty hain Janwar k lye insan ko marty ho The moron of the century, In simple biggest illiterate i have ever heard. Studied in a RSS school - enough to understand the mindset! I like how he realises the evils of both Christianity and Islam. Judaism is pretty evil too. Now talk to jihadi Ravana and kans were the people who destroyed humanity in the ancient time according to our indian texts...<br>There were many more monsters in the past.....<br><br><br>I think lack of education is the main issue, whether christianity or islam, when people start following thein priests without using their own brains, such destructions are obvious...<br><br>Every religion teaches us only about peace, harmony and humanity.<br>But, some idiots take it or understand it in a very different and a violent way....<br><br><br>This can be stopped only with the help of quality of education.......<br><br><br><br>This is just lack of education that&#39;s it.<br><br>Nothing else... Bharat mata ki JAI Wrong wrong, bible was written after 59 years after Jesus restriction, no verse say to stone other believer, give your proof with verse Then what is niyog ? Sirf answer dene wale comment kare baki jinko apni maa bhen kinbezzati karni h wo gali de or khud feeel kare Nech jatvadi, kutha ka Bara bar Sir or agr aap khte he ki islam me ladki ki ijjat nhi hoti to ankh kaan khol le bht se example he dunia me...aaj India ke maximum ameer log UAE jake pesa kamate he apne desh me kro na kuch agr himmat he to.. Muslims ko gali bhi dete ho or unke holy land me jake pesa bhi kamate ho 🙂 Sir agr aap itna hi Quran ke bare me jante ho to kese bol diya apne ki Islam nafrat spread kr rha he..nd chirstanity is the most practiced religion in the world not hindu...plz chnge ur mentality itna andha na bane Anpad jahil insan.. Read Bible first <br>Empty mind devil workshop Don&#39;t miss lead.<br>Bible says  : 1 John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=4m20s\">4:20</a> <br>If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. What he quoted about Surah tawbah verse is only the half verse and not complete . He misunderstood the verse. To compeltely understand that verse, watch this video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RzDCbAhTXDw\">https://youtu.be/RzDCbAhTXDw</a> The guy in the beginning isn&#39;t wrong. Christianity and Islam have a long and bloody history . Kitna nadan hai yeh shakhs, iske bap, dada ke sath agar kuchh hua bhi tha 1947 mein to kya isse sare musalman aur islam qusoorwar honge. Iske purvajon ne kaisa is bechare ke mann mein zaher ghola dusre dhrm ke manne walon ke khilaf? Yeh jo quran se ayatein quote kar raha hai yeh apne hisab se adha adhura kar raha hai. Ise pura context lena chahiye that tab insaf ki bat hoti hai. Jhoot zyada dino tak tikta nahin. Hindu bhaiyon se apeal hai ki in jaison ki baton mein ankh band kar ke yaqin na karein. Balki khud se quran paden aur islam ko saf mann se samjhein. Agree RSS mein padhai ki isi liye chutiya baatein kar raha hai. BC polarizer, aise log Bharat ki waat laga denge Yh media wale ...vs apne aap ko saccha mante h baki sb ko jhutha.... Yes!!  Akash Bhatia .....there is Nationalism ..good representative. Agar hindu aur hindu nationalist hone gunah hai . Toh hume yeh gunah manjoor hai . Meri sab hindu bhaiyo se yahi apeel hai ki gujrati marathi bengali punjabi dalit ko chod kar pehle hindu bano . Tabhi in musalmano ko rok paaenge . Jaihind . Bharat maata ki jai . Please stop this hatred towards us. We live in a secular country, everybody has their own choice to believe what they want to believe. It is shame on us to make our minority feel scared to live in their homeland. It shows how insecure you guys are about your religion you first did this to Buddhism and now Islam and Christianity. All your verses are out of context or not even written. “But I tell you, don’t fight back against someone who wants to do harm to you. If they hit you on the right cheek, let them hit the other cheek too.”<br>\\u202d\\u202dMatthew\\u202c \\u202d<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=5m39s\">5:39</a>\\u202c . This is what Gandhiji quoted but it was from the Bible. Christianity never encourages violence brother please notice that. I am a hindu nationalist too.<br>I am proud. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m51s\">3:51</a> So Yemen is more peaceful than India and Israel. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m47s\">3:47</a> your source says Saudi Arabia is better than India for religious freedom. Really? And China is better than the USA. Are you Muslims or closet Muslims? You could read Bart Ehrman&#39;s How Jesus became God where he states that Bible was written over 300 years starting from 40 years after Jesus&#39;s death. He is BTW a professor at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. So not unsubstantiated but fact. 23 May 2019. Weep losers weep Totally agree with you friend.. Hindus HV woken up This man could use some information. He said, &quot; Constantine declared Jesus the son of God&quot;.. And for all the others who lack scriptural, historical and archeological knowledge... This is for you.<br><br>Did Jesus say &quot;I AM God&quot;? - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jYlxPsiWPvg\">https://youtu.be/jYlxPsiWPvg</a><br><br>Jesus in Islam - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yTzmtzCKTNQ\">https://youtu.be/yTzmtzCKTNQ</a><br><br>Vedas speak about Jesus - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lssaVu_eyso\">https://youtu.be/lssaVu_eyso</a><br><br>Buddha speaks about Jesus - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kOfsmcvTJOk\">https://youtu.be/kOfsmcvTJOk</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=1m17s\">1:17</a> why do you hate Christianity? There is nothing in Christianity to hate.  U can hate a Christian, because he/she probably must have done something wrong... But why Christianity??  EXPLAIN<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m18s\">2:18</a> there is no chapter in the Bible that says to stone a fellow Christian who leaves Christianity.  Christianity is totally based on one&#39;s free will and choices.....  You reap what you sow, your consequences are results of your actions. If Christianity insists on stoning and killing ppl who r leaving Christianity, half of the western nations population should be out by now.. With the rise of atheism, Hinduism, Islam and other world believes. Our nation is going downhill with this mentality!!!!!!

This guy contastine never wrote the BIBLE and it is not written anywhere on the bible to stone your brother if he doesn&#39;t believe in CHRISTIANITY!!!! <br><br>This man is a fraud pls dont believe him!!!! WORLD SECOND LARGEST BEEF EXPORTER IS INDIA! Inida doing the same thing to indian muslims which pakisthan did to Hindu To aap gun uthaoge See everyone is a product of its enviorment and the circumstances they are brought up in<br>U cant hate a person on his ideology<br>He must have been brought up in a negative enviorment Jin logo ne fasaad ki beej boye, wo toh kab ka marr k mitti bann gaye.

Jis chiz k baare mei zyada discussion kiya jaae wahi dimaag mei ghumega keval. <br>Bahar niklo ye hindu muslim hindu muslim se. Sahi Kaha ashram konsa chamatkar kiya hai Assaman se aaya hai Bible kisi ne likha hai Nothing wrong said by him<br>This people just come with new word hindu nationalist Who is he ? What is he ? Y interviewing this ass hole who doesn’t know anything like anything n giving him popularity for this . Someone who says good for unity n m sure u won’t be there. Fucking bastard have no idea why propaganda u guys r falling in And he don&#39;t know nothing about Christianity and Bible.. and mentioning  Bible was written by some Roman Constantine. 🤣🤣.. when you don&#39;t nothing about other religion than mention anything about it.. And according to this man.. Hatred came after the born of Islam and Christianity.. so he means that Hindu was exist way may before than Islam and Christianity.. Hope you heard the story of Adam and eve in the bible.. From the book of Genesis. So did Any Christian Stoned to death his own brother just because his Own brother didn&#39;t believe in Christianity?  Can Anyone tell me? Which religion is suppressing which religion in India? And which Religion is Persecuting which religion in India?  Many Christian are being Persecuted around India. this is a propaganda video and hindu is not a religion but it is a geographical mentioning and sanatan dharm says respect every one&#39;s ideology( i.e. relegions now a days ) and christanity and islam believes are that there is only one god (u may know it better) and rest of them will go to hell, according to this video islam doesn&#39;t display that and that it is highly peaceful, but then idk how come most of the biggest terror organisation uses islam as a weapon, who ever uses religion in a way to spread violence then it should not be considered to represent a religion and i don&#39;t agree that terrorism represents any religion then why coin the term hindu terror or hindu nationalist... Dislikes means likes for this person. I am with you Humne tho history sae sikha hai... Lol asshole wrong reference from the Bible illiterate people passing illiterate comments n people are just watching n believing the man who chew gutta n spreading hatred. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m17s\">2:17</a>... That&#39;s so fake.<br>This is how foolish Hindu&#39;s governs India maybe.... hindu religion me kaun c achi bate likhi h ....<br>manusmriti bhi padh k bata dete ap . Its disturbing that for a man to be rational and non violent one has to necessarily be a gandhivadi , and also taking law into your own hands using lathi to terrorize people parking cars in front of your house and then blaming a muslim guy for doing something “illegal” and valuing the “dead” cows life more than his is clearly justified for him. Also wondering how many politicians must be “in” on all this lynchings as they clearly are call buddies. All the bullshit about the bible is crazy , its a collection of books and its compilation was later but the books did exist on their own way before jesus . The entire Old testament was and unless you expect jesus to write how he was crucified , you must settle for the disciple’s account. This is’nt about religon , this is a death of rationality and humanity . There is no such teaching in the whole Bible to stone to death. It teaches us how to love our enemy. Graham staines and his two inocent sons were burnt to death but how glady staines forgave the culprit. Learn that! How sister Mary&#39;s family forgave the culprit. You are brain washed. Look into a bigger environment.  Little knowledge is dangerous. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=7m02s\">7:02</a> ladki chedna muslaman se sikha hai to bhai musalman ban jaa phir to His claim that the Bible was compiled by Constantine and that it was written 300 years after Jesus died is certainly not true.<br>The new testament was written well within the first century AD , this includes Paul letters and the gospels. Sure Constantine may have had a vested interest in Christianity but that doesn&#39;t mean he wrote the Bible. Even books of the Old Testament like Isaiah have been dated back to more than 500 years before Jesus was born. Also the stoning of an unbeliever is nowhere mentioned in the New Testament in fact Jesus said quite the opposite .  The stoning part he refers to is in the Old Testament and that applied to the Jewish nation and its people that God had called out. That was the old law. Why it was required is a whole other theological question. But to surmise the message of the gospel as condemning non believers by stoning them is not what Jesus intended. Jesus hated sin and not the sinner.  The problem is that there are so many counterfeits to the truth. Jai Shri ram 🕉️ 🕉️ What do you know about Bible? Kuch pata hota nahi hai bas bada sa muh khol kar kuch bhi bol Dena hai.  Bible is a compilation of books written by different Saints. It&#39;s not written by a single man. Pehle Thoda knowledge rakhiye phir bola lijiye.  Christianity teaches about forgiving and loving. Killing is the biggest sin in Bible. Toh Aap bol kaise rahe hain ki Christianity asks to kill your own brother if he doesn&#39;t follow Christianity. TV channels Thoda kam dekha kijiye. O re librandu channel, 2day is 25th may, 2019 &amp; bjp has come in power yet again. Ur disgusting propaganda has failed. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Islam never never spread voilence <br>U can&#39;t find a single verse in Quran against humanity. I challenge who read Quran with translation never miss guide The subtitle in some places so inaccurate! Don&#39;t try to push your personal opinion into what he said! this asswipe is a fucking ignorant piece of shit... Bhai me bhi hindutva ko manta Hu... Mera bhi interview le Meerut aja I will define you the true meaning of hindutva... Wait kr rha Hu tera Jai hindutva jai Modi ji jai BJP jai RSS.....🚩🕉️🕉️🚩🚩🚩🚩🕉️🕉️🕉️🕉️🕉️🕉️🚩🚩🚩 He is absulately wrong in many facts about Islam and History. Islam is mostly tolerent religion thats why India still a Hindu majority country due to 1000 years Islamic rule. People in India need to study more coz wrong information is spreading. Jootha insan hai yeh In Pakistan no one force anyone &quot;Divide and rule&quot;...... Good strategy ... Truth Does anyone realise what the world did when South Africa were racist against the blacks? The same will happen in India if Hindus don&#39;t step up to protect the minorities against the extremists. Islam aur christian ne ashanti failai hai <br>To mahabharat kisne lada jisme 60 lakh hinduo ka katl hua tha. Acha hua wo jung musalmano se nahi hui<br><br>Rahi kashmiriyo ki baat jab kashmiri pandito ka narsinghar hua tha to kya musalmano ki goverment thi ? Satipratha, child marriage and dowry system?? Was it brought to India or it pre-existed in sanathan dharma?? So Explain why saudi arabia has only 6 rape cases and India has over 1000 reported and many unreported rape cases ???? You can see indians supporting him on comments... They have very creepy mindsets.. India&#39;s real face will be shown in the world.. राज तिलक की करो तैयारी<br>आगये है भगवाधारी<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>नरेंद्र मोदी को दुबारा प्रधानमंत्री बनेने के लिए बधाईया Right video good video ..... only go to message of this video and don&#39;t feel bad it is only showing truth..... Dowry System still prevails in almost all the hindu castes but in slam the to be groom is demanded to submit an amount of protection money towards his to be wife . Irony of a Nationalist .. Doesnt know shit about any religion Great bhai aisa hi hona chahiye Go ahead and complete the Chapter 9 .. i bet you will transformer into a secular human being . taking a verse and quoting out of context is just being irrational This guy is right... he is not preaching hate but Hindu pride and rights Gobar khaye aur moot piye to aisa dimagh hota. AUR ha bete surah taubah ki wo aayat mohammad s.a.w se jinki jung hui thi un qafiro k liye aajk begunah non muslim k liye nahi. BALQI quraan begunah non muslim ko maarne par strictly manaa karta h must he coated right about sureh tauba verse 5 ..<br><br>but unfortunately  this guys is understading wrong . <br><br>what he saying islam and christanity worst on earth.whenever these two religions came  from then this bloodshed  is started ...brother u think it because you always see  the  people of books (muslim and christian ) never see the <br>books (quran and bible ).<br><br>once he read the alll scripture of this earth by heart .then he must reverted toward the true religion islam.<br><br>yeeh it is prohibited in islam to impose islam  forcely any one..<br>there is no any force in religion.what ever u want to practice you can here.but here after there is only one religion is acceptable that is islam .<br><br>those who forces that old man  to accepted islam and eating beef ..those are worst among creature. What an innocent statement made by him.... !!!! In this election, Godse won. Bhai tum jawab do Saudis Arab me rap kyun nahi hota.Waha to Muslim majority hein.Tum itne bardhe pandit nahi ho ke tum islam ki to durga ki baat hein apni dharm ko pura jaan sako.Hamare yaha bhi to hindu hein.aur mera bachpan 24 ghante mein 14 ghanta hindu ke bhich mein hein hi gujara hein. Subha tuition,school,dosto ke saath Khelna Saab.pata hein kya hein tab na dimag me ye khayal ata hi nahi tha.pata nahi kya soch ke rakha he tum logo ne?chalo Muslim bhag gaya  ya phir sare muslim mar gaya tab kiske saath ladoge ladna to hein tum ko.yar log khud se lad rahe hein.mein ye bat sirf tumko nahi bata raha hun.un sari hindu,Muslim,Christian se bol raha hu jo aise bhabna rakhte hein.<br>          Tum bologe Muslim kharap,ham  bolenge hindu kharap wo bolega Christian kharab.kyu bolte hein pata hein ham khud hi nahi Jante hein hi ki hamara dharam kya hein. Ye JAHIL hai. He is brainwashed about Islam since his childhood .<br>You can imagine about the thinking of a Sanghi !!!! Tumhare devi devta sab maderchod hai hindu jaat marderchod bhenchod sab ko saale log ko goli maardena chahiye Saala feku aadmi jaha mila saale ko goli maardo Ueh aadmi jama mila usko goli maardo saale ko HINDU JAAT MADERCHOD OMG THIS GUY IS KNOWLEDGEABLE Lol Constantine hahaha as a Christian what he said about the Bible verse exist nowhere lol An example of Andh Bhakt This guy is so wrong!! Jesus told his disciples that if they went to a town to preach and the people didn&#39;t want to hear, they should move on. The bible doesn&#39;t tell us to kill non-christians rather it tells us to love our enemies and to do unto others as we would like others to do unto us. The Holy Bible was also not written 1700 years ago. It written from the time of Moses and other chapters were added as time passed. Constantine never wrote the Bible but was infact the first christian Emperor. This guy is goddamn right. He spoke truth in each and every word of his. The guy is woke af. I hope my Hindu brothers and sisters also learn something from him. Very interesting.........islam ke aane se rape bdha india or mhilao pe Aatyachar hua...........sati pratha islamme tha kya jnab.......or islam 1400 sal phle nhi aaya ....islam ki history tb se h jb se duniya bna ........khair kro nfrt .....tumhari mrji.....jyada se jyada kya kr doge nfrt me jan le loge......le lo jan..... .<br><br>Ek swal h inse jo inhone kha ki vo gayy la rga tha to mar diya tb....ye swal kuu nhi puchte apne govt se ki gayy ke export me india no. 1 kuu h ...kuu nhi use marte ho ..isliye ki beef exporter hindu h......... Now make in mindset of Muslim nationalist I love this guy 😍👍👍 he speaks absolute truth. He said My family is a nationalist. In the subtitles its shown &#39;my family is a hindu nationalist&#39;.Hindu hatred at its best. Absolutely true brother God bless these souls The Bible does not said to stone any body. Fuck all of you 😂😂😂. Asli bjp wala Right Angela Merkel actually supported muslim immigrations. Correction!! A bitter fact. Lol, the video backfired 🤣😂😂 Lack of education, lack of observation is leading him to think below poverty.poor fellow Personally netas will destroy you one day...... Hindu and nationalist are synonyms to each other every hindu is a nationalist and every nationalist is hindu . Hinduness is very broad then you think it is not a religion ,it is a culture, it is a ideology, it is a way of life. Wait For Gazwa Bro The person who born in hate can never be a Nationalist and the way he describes the situation he faced and created him eventually a product of RSS or Terrorist if you see the life of any terrorist he faced much worst situation so there are more chances of destruction.... Thus such kind of hate mentality is sick they all need to see a psychiatrist whether they are Hindu Muslim Sikh or Isai This guy is the best example of a brain washed child. All that He said against Christianity, is just a blatant lie. Nowhere in the Bible has it written to stone someone to death if they are not Christians. <br>Stoning to death punishment mentioned in the Bible, was given only to Jewish ancestors and not to others and that to for people who commits adultery or sins like that. And by the way that has nothing to do with Christianity.  No where in the Bible is instructed that Christians should kill others. <br>Jesus said to love even your enemies and pray for them. Jesus said if you are slapped on one side turn your other cheek. That&#39;s what is taught to christians. I dont know which Bible did this guy read to accuse what he is accusing. Viewer should observe that he didnt mention any reference to Bible to prove his statements. He cant do it also as it&#39;s never there in the Bible.<br>If what he said is true, then Christians should be stoning others to death  in India. And we never seen or heard any such cases in India, even in the places where Christians are dominant. <br>There should be a limit to lying too. You cannot attribute anything and everything to show that others are bad and you are good. Come on... please speak some truth. Is this what they taught you in your schools? No wonder, this is why people like this man are filled with hatred and bitterness as they dont know the truth but are just brainwashed by their maters with lies, for their selfish gains. one thug from stinky atmosphere Iski gand pe modi ka tatto hoga sirf m n di banvaya hoga o to iski badi hai already iske thobre se dikh raha hai jab v jukk kar modi ke tatte chat ta hoga gand pa modi likha dikhega lora bhakt. Shakal se hi gunda lagg raha hai When he speaks about Bible he is so away from the truth.. whatever he had mentioned that was not in the Bible... simple speaking. Is tarah ke bande asal khatra hai hindustan me <br>the end is near...! It shows how much hate he is having inside him for religions <br>We can do nothing of these kind of peoples<br>Literally they are a big stitch in the name of humanity Brain washed. Knows nothing Few points he is correct about but about women harassment he is not. Sati pratha parda pratha were on even before Muslims came. Adha gyaan poori backchodia Mandir wahin banana hai ,<br>Abhi to kai aur masjid ko girana hai . 23 May ki karo tayyari ,<br>Aa rahe hein bhagwa Dhari .<br><br>Jai Shree Ram .. <br>Mandir wahin banayenge , <br>abhi to aur masjid girayenge . 💪💪💪 Ye jo bhi bol raha hai shayad apne experience ke base per bol raha hai.... but jahan tak knowledge ki baat hai..ise aadha gyan hai...Koi bhi dharm ke baare mei jaanna hai to uske follower ko mat dekho us dharm ki book ko explore karo and m 100% sure koi bhi dharm galat nahi hoga....rahi baat is bande nei jo quran ki kuch verse ke baare mei bataya hai is bande ka koi kasoor nahi kisi ne iske mind mei daal diya hai galat tarike se...I m Proud Indian Muslim..and I love my religion Islam and love this Land...Jai Hind. They are nothing but a brain washed human by their politicians Aisi gathiya soch rakhne wala kya btayega kisi religion k bare me. It&#39;s showing how much you are educated in all terms, ZERO... Why seculars don&#39;t cry for kashmiri pandits?<br>Why seculars don&#39;t cry for sikh ginocide organised by congress?<br>Why seculars don&#39;t cry for ram lingham murdered by Muslims for opposing force conversions in tamil nadu? Draupadi Ko ka muslimo ne jau me hara tha ni na wo sb Hindu hi the Aur Draupadi ka rape ka muslim me Kia tha..?? Ye chahte h k ya pr terrorism pehle kr logo Ko Dara kr rkhe Jai hind Wow..! Isko pm banao... &quot;Bhai sahab personally BJP neta ko call kar dete Hain&quot; Kuchh bhi😆😆 Nice video. It&#39;s sad that he really believes what he is saying. But at least you should also blur his face. Please don&#39;t let him face unwarranted hate from the internet. India is a Hindu nation. No doubt about it. If you want India as a secular country, talk of making all the muslim countries secular too. I know this is ridiculous, but atleast start talking about the negative tendencies of your beloved minority. Kuch bhi ho jaay, kitna bhi andh keh lo hume, kitne bhi funny videos kar lo... Kabhi kabhi to hume bhi ye videos pasand aate hain. lekin ek baat samaj lo. ab Hindu har vakt vote Hindu ko hi dene wala hai yaad rakhna. Congress ko aur unke pyare minority ko humne 60 saal diye sudharne ke liye, aur wo bhi unhe kam pad gaye. Humse bade andh to muslims hain jo dimag se nahi balki apne dharm se sochte hai. Islam and Christianity is aliens in India. A religion is not defined by its scriptures or its prophets. But rather by the behaviour and actions of its flock. <br>Attack the bad and defective behaviour in all faiths never the faith it self. <br>Hard learned lessons of a lifetime of thinking about this. No matter what u say I love my India most.. Shakal par lanat baras ri hai, mun se sirf nafrat ki baat. Kuch pata nahi hai bas baaten banara hai. This guy told the reality Good Job.. now take an interview from Muslim nationalist as well. Pl be secular not sickular!☺ Nothing can be done to this country until this feeling of hatred against other religions and cast&#39;s exist... consider every person is beautiful on their own...respect people&#39;s view on their religion...try to help the poor irrespective of religion... after all nobody is going to take anything after death... ✌️ Well he is not wrong though are bhavla  vo ayat  arab ke kabilo pr likhe gye thi  aur rahi bat bible ki to kab likhe gye tere bat bhi man le to bhagwat gita kab likhe Gye thi ye bta mitk ke sikar Chutiye saala hai ye .....watsapp university ka gyan peley jaa raha hai.....🤣😂 This man is speaking like an intellectual Gobar dimag Poora Wrong Bol raha hai ye Har kise kaa khoon milaa hai iss mitti mai .... Kise k Baap kaa Hindustaan thodi hai I think such peoples are anti national who have such hatred against their own Indians Brothers only becoz  they are belong to different religion.<br>This thinking will leads to country in Darkness He seems completely brainwashed and possessing very little ( wrong) knowledge of Islam. <br>Islam is the only religion in this planet which upgrades the structure of women in the society and imposing a death penalty for rapists. <br>I hope our brothers would acquire detailed knowledge of Islam and Qur&#39;an and not the fabricated one Spreading  secularism is an anti nationalism I respected him a lot, he is turning out to be an idiot .. 🤐 North pura uneducated hai kuch b bol dete Bc even I&#39;m a Hindu don&#39;t bring such topics. I have Christian friends and Muslim friends. Stop making such foolish videos Hahahah Islam ane se pahle sati jaisi paratha... gao gao mai dayaan bana k mara jana...choot achoot ye sb Islam ane se pahle tha ya ab hai ???? Hathyar othane wale baat par tum terrorist  jaisi jhalak ati hai Kaise mind wash kiya hai aam logo ka ... last mai sahi baat bol diya hum logo yani BJP walo ko faida hora bsss...samjh lo Now this..... he ain’t a nationalist.....faker....😑 and don’t send your kids to Shishu mandir.....this is the outcome......narrowminded Every single thing this guys is saying is debatable and lies utterly in a big bubble of the hinduwadi india. But i really admire and fear his easement while he states his mind. Fuck Ugly face of India!! He must be a Dan brown fan How’s funny 😂 definition plz call him for lecture @ Oxford  ! And ask this guy that why RSS is operating rashtiya Muslim munch ! This wing of RSS Nice thinking man love from Pakistan Kuch Bhi Bak Rha Hai Bhai Yeh<br>Qur&#39;an Or Bible Ka Kuch Nhi Aata Isko Bakwas Kar Raha Hai<br><br>RSS Jese Terrorist Group Ki Chatr Chaya Me Padha Or Pala Hua Aadmi Qur&#39;an Ya Bible Padhega<br><br>That&#39;s Stupid Ek Vichrdhara Ko Lekr Jeene Wala Insan Gadhe Se Zada Kuch Nhi Hota.<br><br>Humanity is the First Religion Welp even I&#39;m an Hindi natisonalist and everything he said is truth . This is such a chutiya person. Should make a similar video with a Muslim fundamentalist in India. Bahot tagda nafrat hai... 100%  what happened happening on Hindus . All these guys who are saying he’s right.<br>Please if you are Hindus read Manu smriti and then decide can there be more discrimination and then comment on other religions.<br>I am a staunch Hindu but I don’t care what others believe in. Hinduism is not polytheistic religion.<br>Advaitha says there’s one soul.<br>Dwaitha says there’s one god and souls which depends on god.<br>So Hinduism is qualified polytheism which is all gods have different forms but is ultimately one. Hey Stupid always interpreting wrong bible n Quran bible new testament was written directly by the disciples of Christ. I did a video proving that Hinduism is the most anti-Indian religion. I also did two series proving Christianity right in different ways: &quot;Atheism and Atheist Creation Myths REFUTED&quot; and &quot;Proof Satan Rules The World Ergo The Bible is Right.&quot; This guy doesn&#39;t even know what Christianity is since he takes people at their word gullibly. He would take Hitler at his word when Hitler said he was a Christian (refuted by his anti-Christ actions), and so if consistent, this Hindu xenophobe would believe Hitler if Hitler told him that Hitler would respect his country&#39;s sovereignty, and that he wanted only peace. :-) There are two kinds people in India, one who thinks religion as paramount and another who thinks religion is total bull crap, Don&#39;t call them nationalists, they are extremists, be it Hindu or Muslim if they think their religion is perfect and blames other religion his an extremist. People like him are a curse. I am a nationalist, but I believe that religion is the main reason why India is poor and have low social upliftment . Religion is the real curse Excellent !! Kashmir is officially an Islamic Republic having its own constitution which do not mention at a single place about the fundamental rights in A &quot;SECULAR&#39;&#39; REPUBLIC OF INDIA which NEHRU wanted india to be but Kashmir and Article 35A and 370 empowers it. That&#39;s a true Hindu. He has my vote. Read Quran Chapter 8 here and decide for yourself:<br><a href=\"https://quran.com/9\">https://quran.com/9</a> Tmhare hisab se duniya ki aadhi abadi Jo ki Christianity aur Islam ko follow Karti hai Jo sab galat hai. Bhai Islam ne aurat zaat ki izzat Karna sikhaya duniya ki varna pahle to paida hote he ladki ko maar Diya jata tha.<br>Ek tmhare Modi ji he Jo bhagwan hai. Ok fine now make a video on muslim and cristian fundamentalists. There should be balance in your reporting na. It is clearly seen in the video that the guy is acting its not a actual survey. So dont fool us. If you dare go and questions to those guys who support terrorist in the name of bhatke hue naujawan Bahot saare pagal supporter hain bjp ke They thought seedha saadha aadmi hai isko phasa lenge....but isne kya band bajadi inn pseudo seculars ki What he said is the absolute truth....the makers of the video are trolling themselves😅😅 I am a mad Hindu gadha We need a hindu nation first of all : No one has a rights to blame anyone&#39;s religion <br>second thing : The beauty of INDIA Lies in its diversified culture of all religion.<br>Third thing : when we Call it religion so it means TRUTH so nobody can judge anyone&#39;s belief<br>4 and the most important thing is :   we As a Indians wanted to see ourself in better position comparatively to other developed countries in the world rather than fighting among ourself. JAIHIND Islam aaj ka nhi jab insan aya duniya pe tabhi se hai islam who the fuck is this guy and why he is still alive in this world...........wtffffffffff he just said.. Tumeh Quran aur Bible ka kuch maloom hi nahi hai bhai... Good guy. Absolutely clear where the problem lies He is a humble son of the soil! Every Indian citizen must watch him and learn!👍🙏 Bhai hamara desh 2tukda ho Gaya ek dharm ka bajesha ku ab secularism hamari desh ma ha secularism ban kara Sabsa purana dharm sa ha ham proud to be a Hindu 1400 salsa gandh machataha ek dharm Sara world ma BIBLE k bare me galat jankari rakhe hai. Thanks to MODI government and his political party.. India is going down.. India cannot accommodate its own people their own blood and skin just because they are Muslims... What a beautiful country and values you politicians are teaching.. THE DESTRUCTION OF INDIA BY INDIANS not China, nor Pakistan... By MODI and his political party... China becoming more stronger and India cannot handle its own people by starting Hindus Muslims war... Diplomat(anti hindu anti national pseudo secularism(sickularism)) Tum Aidi ka Chot lagha do islam badh raha hei our Badhta hi rahenga insha Allah... Bhala Hi tume kitna bhi bura laghe This is Guy, Half Knowledge,  Islam Never Teaches to Disrespect women <br>“And for women are rights over men, similar to those of men over women.”\\xa0Qur’an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m22s\">2:22</a>8\\xa0, Due to Some Extremists or Terrorists,  you Cannot Justify that,  If you are talking about rape and Sexual Harassment,  that I can see more in North Regions Compare to other parts of India, Its not   kind of any Distinguishment,But People Should educated, they Should be liberal and Open Minded. Anpad aur gawar bankar aaye ho is duniya may aur isay hi markar jaaogay......read the holy book of QURAN then u will know,wt is truly written ...... This guy doesn&#39;t know shit about Christianity. I don&#39;t know about his total story but this man&#39;s Bible statement is wrong. Pahla Quraan e paak ko pado ज़हर घोलने का काम कर रहा है। Pakistan will be more than happy to see Chaiwala as India&#39;s PM because he will only smear the face of India before the world. Chaiwala is no match for Imran Khan who is a graduate of Oxford and has 100 times better image than Chaiwala. Neighboring country like Bangladesh will also be benefited as nationalist and religious parties will be boosted by the politics of BJP. India&#39;s selling of secularism prescription will be over and religious political parties of neighboring countries will get their momentum. Bhai tu ek bat to kahna hi bhool gya ki tere paida hone mai bhi Islam ka hi &quot;hath&quot; hai😂 aaj Islam ki wajah se hi mai paida hua hu mtlb bakchodi ki bhi hadh hoti hai 😁😁😁 love India😘😘😘 It is a paid content. I am an Atheist and dislike all Religions in General but I like the Hindus a lot, The Greatest and Noblest People on the face of the Earth. The Hindus welcome everyone with a Smile and Continue to do so even today. They Share what remains of their Once Greater Nation with People of the Same Faiths that were responsible for Slaughtering them, Colonizing them and Enslaving them for past 1500 years !!! Loved his confidence how he claims to know, the complete Bible. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m50s\">2:50</a> in the same video you can see the text that contradicts his statement. The time stamp that he talks about when the Bible was written, loved it. I wish, he was given the truth, about the Christianity. Lord Jesus came in human form, so that he would show the human being, how to live life Peacefully. This brother mentions that after Christianity came, there is no peace in the world, even a small kid would agree to that, wars, fights, ruling ... Have been there even before the Christ was born. I ask this question to my Hindu Brothers... What does Mahabharat Talks about. I thank the media for clarifying, the fact at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m50s\">2:50</a> ... If you spread anything spread the truth, love and peace.

XD<br>Anyway half the facts he&#39;s stating are as fake as hindi serials lol Hahhahahahahha..... This is exactly what happens when your mind is filled Gaumutra and gobar If Islam brings the concept of &quot; suppressing of women&quot; then what  does your Hindu culture of burning the women alive &quot; sati&quot; came from?<br>And for your information Constantine wasn&#39;t the author of Bible.<br>Most of the rape case in India are committed by the Devi worshippers fanatic Hindus .<br><br>Just take a look in all the Christian states  , look at there crimes against women , literacy , pollution, human environment.<br><br>Hindus believe cows as mother but your Hindustan is the biggest exporter of beef.<br>Incredible India. Blind...🙄 I think one day India will be fucked up.... You dont have proper knowledge about islam you have a wrong statement about islam and muslim  islam and christen both relegion are old then hindu religion.. Perfectly said One thing we simple cannot deny is pseudo secularism 🙏<br>On one hand you say minorities are tortured but on the other hand more than 10k muslims attend yakub memom funeral after he was hanged . Wow It seems the video backfired for good and that unsubstantial claims disclaimer is just to appease librandus 90% of it was true. Every Indian nationalist should have the same mindset,Cox India is a Hindu country Title of this video sucks..the guy is a simple man talking facts.. saraswati shishu mandir me pade baccho ks dimag bahut creative hota h ....ajmer dargah maleganw samjhuta jaipur delhi or na jane kitne bomb blast jo sahid hemant karkare sahab clear karne wale the  sab uska example h ...... Get Well Soon Ek sawal DAWOOD IBRAHIM KASKAR and THAKARE me koi difference batay Mere bhi HINDU SE CHID HAI Hahha this man is a shit bhai konsi history pdta h....... 😂 😂 😂 😂 Shame to all those who disrespect father of nation Well don&#39;t forget it&#39;s .... Arabs that named Hindus.... Before that it was idol worshipers or sanatan Dharam...... Huh........ One who don&#39;t respect father of nation   how can be a patriot.... These are true traitors Bharat me muslim minority me kyu h <br>Inhe inki drja wapas lena chahiye This man is say that muslims and Christians are not my enemy . but he  declares war on religion Islam and christianity . He is true hindu mujahid  . Also the Bible never tells to punish  non believers, Never! Oh so its ok for pakistanis to hold islamic fundementalism but hindus cant hold hindu fundementalism This is exactly what 80 crore Hindus think ... he is just on screen . Hinu always rape the girls Islam doesn&#39;t allow it if you rape a girl in Arab country you will be executed in public His knowledge is very poor he doesn&#39;t know anything.accept Islam by your choice Wanna be politician ... terko b ticket hona kya election ka ...Bina Kam k pyade Garib  Insan Ko tu palraha hai kya ..tere jaise imandar to paida nahi hua ..terko Theka Mila hai kya samaj ka ... What a sad state of humanity. After reading many comments, I know am wasting my time writing. We spend 90% of our lives talking about our religion and how to save it but we don&#39;t want to follow it&#39;s teachings. There is no threat to any religion. There&#39;s only threat to humanity, that we r loosing day by day, still we talk about religion all day. People have an open mind and think about your future generations. Apne desh ko priority do not religion. Angrez Sikha kar Chale Gaye and politicians are using it well. Divide and rule. Good luck Indians. Musalmanu ke gulam Thank God we are Pakistani Ghr k samne jaam lgne pe ....jaan le lo.....wah BJP wahh....... Thats why now I don&#39;t believe in God nor in any religion we all need to buycot these god&#39;s and religion to save our great nation Wow politics is all about religion. Usne galat kya bola? I think his last comment was understandable It&#39;s RSS point of view. Don&#39;t mix up Hindu nationalism. N many points he raised seems correct. Secularism is good but that concept is meaningless when u are living with a significant no. of Abrahamic faiths...Abrahamic faiths are always on competetion of numbers which makes people from other faiths afraid. Gandu islam pehle pad le education k baare me kya h islam jaahilo Quran Mai duosro Kay barai Mai bagair janai kush kahana ek kawarij ka kaam hai Bhai ya baat sirf ek khawarij hi karsakta hai I am worried that minds like these will destroy INDIA... all i want is peace and love among INDIANS ..instead of fighting each other in the name of religion...to everyone out there..please dont destroy our country.... I LOVE MY INDIA For everyone to hear and know .... islam never  supported or promoted violence... it is infact said that in quran...if a person kills a man, it is as if he has killed the entire humanity..... so people who create violence is not muslims ,they just have muslim name. They doesnt follow islam&#39;s ideology, they dont know what islam really is... Nor does hindu religion or christian religion promotes or supports violence. But some people who claim to be the protectors of their religion seems to be actually destroy it by showing violence all in the name of their religion.... so people like them are the real enimies of their religion and also of our country INDIA... i never hated any religion or a person who is of another religion...but always had tried to make a good impression on them. that is what i learnt in my life... but,  i always had hated people who uses their religion inorder to create violence and chaos whether he is a muslim, hindu or christian or any other religion... i have given most of my respect and love to people of  other religion... i live in kerala,thanks to god, and we live in  a mixed society ..we exchange food in different occassion to our neighbours...whether its  Eid ,ramadan , vishu, onam etc.... and we love each other and doesnt not hate each other....above all WE ARE INDIANS.... This man is the reflection of the great modi 😂 अंध भक्त कितने जाहिल होते हैं,,,इस गधे को कुछ  भी पता नहीं है,,<br>और अपने को बड़ा गियानी समझ रहा है,,, RSS के स्कूल में पड़ा है तो इस को गधा बोलने की ज़रूरत नहीं है,, Aur haa uncle let me teach you something <br>Sawarkar was not veer <br>He was a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23gadddar\">#gadddar</a> Hey guys why to believe others it&#39;s out life <br>Please please don&#39;t make any opinion study Islam and everything<br>And after all he is an <br>CHADDI GANG MEMBER (RSS) Bc musalman maaro There is no verse in the Bible that says &quot;if your real brother doesn&#39;t believe in Christianity, then stone him to death.&quot; In fact, the Bible teaches to even &quot;Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.&quot; This is the sad state of nationalists and Hindutva people. The starting point is NOT knowledge, but hate. I want to say to all those who resonate with this person. With love I speak, please introspect, study, and realise that you&#39;re caught in the trap of hate and violence, not justice and freedom like you assume.<br><br>Also, everything he said about the Bible is false. Bible was not written after 300 years of Jesus’ resurrection 😀... Bible is not a single book but a collection of 66 Books written over 1800 years....the New Testament was written between 45AD to 90 AD...so that does not make 300 years .... the first book of the New Testament was written in 45 AD and the last was in 90 AD... how on earth does it make 300 years..😀..Bible was not written by Constantine.... 😅...he helped in spreading it.... Bible was written by some 40 authors sir.... sad to see your ignorance... There is no verse in New Testament that non-Christians have to be stoned😀 in fact we are asked to love them... if non- Christians should be stoned according to Bible why is that most of the Indians are fleeing to Christian countries..?? I wish he spoke after some homework... Interview lene wale ne dhokha diya h iss admi ke sath<br>Kuch bhi likh de rha h correction ke naam pe😢😢😢😢 hahaa what an interview ... there is no sound of a reporter or the guy who is asking questions Indian plz be rational be educate Ye khud kah raha hai ki muslim christen ki wajah se hinsa chalu hui aur ab khud violence kar raha hai These bastards have nothing to offer for their country - except hate and destruction of the country - just like their forefathers - who<br>*Opposed the freedom struggle <br>*Actively participated for the partition<br>*Boot licked the british and wiped their ass<br>*Killed the greatest man India has ever seen and garlanded his killer<br>Not to mention the present prime moron and his goons who have killed scores of muslims and dalits and completely destroyed the social fabric of this country with his shitty ideology  <br>And destroyed the economic structure of the country Never try to take interview of muslim hates Modi गलत क्या बोला?

Aaj sare hindu ka asli chehra samne as gaya 4.21 ye to andh lund bhakt nikla ,,, 😂😂😂😂 This is the face of India and anyone that disagrees can read the comments where overwhelming percentage agrees with this man. What do you mean unsubstantiated claim..  the historical and archeological proofs have shown that the actual culture was primarily open  minded was not the culture of restriction... Half knowled....🤣🤣🤣 Wtf!!  Hindus have so much hatred for Muslims and Christians... Modi govt is fooling and brainwashing.... And I cannot imagine the future of our country as all hundus are making their hatred obvious... Sad😔 Dropati ne 5 shadian Karin thin to aap bhi apni Biwi ki 5 shadian karado let&#39;s be secular :-) Chuteya tu le jamin aur mandir bana all terrorists are not hindu but all rss are terrorists one day this mindset of terrorism will destroy everyone. Look like a Nazi tell about other religions except Christanity. Iski bevakoofi ka andaza isi se lagaya ja sakta he &quot; Muslims ke aane se pehle koi ladkiyo ko nahi chhed ta tha&quot; This man has been brainwashed by RSS . According to him , discrimination against women was not in Indian society untill Islam came . He needs to read Vedas and about Sati . <br><br>RSS is giving biased and hateful education in its school Jis josh se Dusre dharmo ko latad raha he usi josh se Hinduism ko defend kar raha he........<br>Truth is that every religion is Cancer for our world. Bhagwa Atankwadi in the making . Giving tough competition to jihadis . <br><br>RSS is right there on its agenda Honest person Tere pas tark hi nahi hai sirf bakwas bakwas aur bakwas YEH SIRF CHAU PIYEGA SAARI ZINDAGI AURR KHAALI BAKCHODI MAAREGA YEH CHUTIYA HAMARE YAHA BHEEK MAANGKAR D<br>TOH DAARU PITA HAI CHUTIYA🤣🤣😂😂😂😂 Tu ek taraf se bakchodi karega to kya jhooth Sach ho jayega Abe  chutya tera aukaat nai jo quraan Or bible me kya likha h uske present krne ka qk tumjhe kavi smjhhi nai ayega jahil The verse he quote from Qur&#39;an is wrong. Check out the verse from Qur&#39;an Surat At Tawbah chapter no.9. Which is totally different from what he was spilling in this video. I wonder how these journalists post such videos without doing any homework? I suggest this brother to read the whole book peacefully. Then comment. I wonder his upbringing was in such a worse environment where there&#39;s no logic of guidance. I pray for you to think wise and also when you read, read the whole context and then give your statement. It&#39;s a request. And a request to the journalists to do your homework. Read out the scriptures before you post such videos make sure that the person who is spilling about the scripture is exactly the same or not.what a shame! I&#39;m It&#39;s all about perspective......he studied in  saraswati shishu mandir and got the definition of nationalism as per the syllabus taught in the shakha. ... this is not what everyone thinks. i saw many comments of indian fascists  defending the that RSS goon<br>these fascist hindu nationalists are gonna tranform my india into 30s germany.. I personally want an atheistic dictator to rule the country with an iron fist. All religions needs to be destroyed including hinduism in order to properly flourish in the future. Some of his points are kinda valid but i lost my shit when he started blaming muslims and christians for the high rapes and uneducation in the country. That is such a convinient excuse, blaming the minorities when the majority keeps raping their women. Sala tu fakher hai... This rss is Why India and Pakistan are not friends. Ye batare  ke  Islam aye  to lakdi  ku  chedte  hai...phir  rapes  rates Hinduism  kyu  zyada  hai..sab  BJP  ka kamal...hai Has the social hostilities index of india reached a height of 8.7 due to a hindu nationalist....take a gud look at the list at 3.51 and point out the countries where muslims are not involved....why does this pattern exists...was the exodus of thousands of kashmiri pandits an act of a hindu nationalist.... Was the burning of sabarmati express in godhra the work of a hindu nationalist....hindus have beared witness to a long lasting period of tyranny under mughals and britishers... Its high time we call the bullshit on this secularism.... 3.46...the map shows china to be a state with moderate religious violence.... Does xinjiang or uighar muslims ring any bells....wht kind of a channel is this...???? It&#39;s that same Draupadi who was disrobed in the court of Hastinapura... He don&#39;t know B of Bible .. Sorry no hard feelings For mother india....we do every thing... Just an average guy speaking the truth Funny because this guy sounds a lot like a radical Muslim 🤣🤣 His quotes from Islam and &quot;Constantine wrote Bible&quot; explains general knowledge of a typical &quot;Hindu Nationalist&quot; as per your title of the video...Damn we have ruined our country in the name of religion...Enough with this crap...If someone is an Indian, he/she is an Indian only...don&#39;t care abt religion This Guy Brain Washed like Talibans and Abuesment of women happen in Ramayan he is not telling truth.. Let us save Sanatan Dharma! He is so biased and sounds like BJP spokesperson 😊<br>Yr hate aise videos dekhne baad aata h aur spread hota h Dropadi ke time Islam Aya tha kya. Cheerharan kyu hua tha uska Ye hota hai unpad admi, dusre ke religion Ko extreminist bata kar debate start Kiya aur end khud extreminist ban kar end Kiya.. har har mahadev 🗣🗣 He doesn&#39;t know humanity, than how can he understand Islam which teach the same hate some muslim named bloody animals why u hate Islam first study Islam what it is otherwise u r the looser.... Bhai sahthiya gai tu kya bol raha he What&#39;s funny is that these are the kind of people who are in queue outside Christian and Muslim countries embassies in india, day in and day out just to get their visa or their nationality lol.. shame on these hypocrites Brainwashed I pity him though An idiot who doesn&#39;t know abt the verses of both the holy books and he is interpreting it on its own as he feel to This man is totally ignorant BJP supporters are idiot&#39;s WE WILL ALWAYS FOLLOW HINDUISM AKA SANATAN DHARMA BECAUSE IT&#39;S THE WORLDS FIRST RELIGION. GOOGLE IT IF IT&#39;S NOT THE FIRST IT&#39;S FAKE. 🌎🚩<br><br>Let&#39;s see why world hates islam and the pedofile Muhammed who rapid a 6 year old child named aisha.<br><br>Quran (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m56s\">3:56</a>) - &quot;As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.&quot;<br><br>Quran (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m15s\">3:15</a>1) - &quot;Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority&quot;.\\xa0 This speaks directly of polytheists, yet it also includes Christians, since they believe in the Trinity (ie. what Muhammad incorrectly believed to be &#39;joining companions to Allah&#39;). First of all percisely fit title<br><br>Islam and Christianity comprise more than 50% population. By relating every coloniser with a common Christian and every terrorist with a ordinary Muslim you are dehumanizing more than 350 crore people. It&#39;s gross disrespect of God&#39;s creation. (50% mistake ratio to govt. Officials ka bhi nhi hota 😂😂)<br><br>And it is quite pathetic that how nonchalantly one uses euphemism of &#39;Nationalist&#39; for his last stage mental imbalance. No, every act done just with the rhetoric of doing it for one&#39;s Nation is not a patriotic act.<br><br>I&#39;m not a stupid to nurture hatred against 1/4 th of humanity for something wrong done to me by some handful people. I know it&#39;s hard but that&#39;s what my religion has taught me.<br><br>No we don&#39;t want a Hindu Nation because we have ample example around us to show that when a religion become Nation then how other important issues get sidelined.We don&#39;t want India to be next Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Israel.  I agree that majority of prime terrorist organization are run by Muslims but wait do a common Muslim get benefitted from that? No, a big No. Their own children get slaved, daughters raped, young people get killed. No one is benefitting from terrorism except a few people. And that aren&#39;t 100% Muslims, America was benefitted because it helped it restrain Russia, arm exporters get their business running, a few among many things.<br><br>We also have example of naxals, which are majorly Hindus. Do this make entire Hindusim terrorist? NO NO NO<br><br>Don&#39;t tell us how to live. We know our religion well. No religion is impeccable. We Hindus too have issues but that&#39;s how life works. We are aware of problems regarding sati, untouchability, caste system, dowry etc but we will solve them with our finest characteristic e.g. positive tolerance, respecting others, helping needy intact.<br><br>Jai Hind terorist stupid religion . It is really very sad watching this video. How people in this country are hateful towards us. We were born in this country too. <br>I used to proudly say that I am an Indian citizen and this is my country. But now, I am afraid. <br>I have felt personally this too.<br><br>Are we really safe in this country? After reading comment section there are many non Muslims who feel threatened from Islam. I have a suggestion for them criticize as much as you can but after reading Quran and understanding it&#39;s relevant context from authentic Muslim scholar so that you  of A<br>don&#39;t go astray. Do not hesitate to read the book as it is not only for Muslims but for whole of humanity. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m55s\">6:55</a> toh beta kyun india mein itne rape hote hai? Abhi vo ek bacchi ka rape kiya tha kyunki vo muslim thi. Hindus did that, yahi hai pooja tumhari? He is right....🙏🙏🙏...but we have to change our education system......like gurukul that&#39;s yahi tarika hai azadi ka....... education uncle .... kutto jeisey bhi akal nahi hai Nationalism does not mean extremism chutiya sala iske jaise aur bhi hai comment section me ddka mai...garbage is admi ke saare fact galat hain...yahi frak hai aam indian me aur rss walo me inka brainwash hai pori tarah...kaun kehta hai hindu religion me ladkiyo se beed bhaav muslim invasion se baad hua...manu smriti ane ke baad se ye hindu mahila ki dayneey halat hue ye rss wale manu smriti laagu karna chahte hain india me wich is aby far impossible aur aise chutiya logo ki koi jagah nahi hai india me...inke dimaag ja guu inhi ko sada dega sad ke mar jayenge ye sale... I liked this vedio only for the &quot;nationalist&quot; not for the psudo secular journalism 😁 These Hindus is master mind the know everything in the world Great man. I&#39;m an Indian and I can confirm scumbags like him exist in huge number in my country. Islamic terrorist ke dimaag me 72 huree chalta hai Read Bharat jhunjhunwala&#39;s book! True face shown What are Hindus scared of so much? It&#39;s okay if you hate a religion and criticise it but you&#39;re crossing the line when you think followers of that religion should be killed or neglected and use this propaganda to gain votes He is a joke when Muslim rule India we gave u culture like salwar kameez and shirwani and koosa and more also food architecture langauag like urdu u use in Hindi so many take hindu copy Muslim still they don’t have shame u people were slave that’s a faact we made u slave for 1000 years that’s why u copy us even modi he wear clothes that’s the dress of Muslim and when ur army dog die u call him shaheed it’s islamic word u hindu don’t have shame left any way how is abinandan Bai jaaaaaan still no shame infront of international media u got humiliated 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Ye admi sahi kaha raha ye Hinduke liye modi sahi ye I mean he is not wrong. Neither he knows Hinduism correctly nor Islam nor Christianity ... he is simply a blind useless bimbo who has no job except loitering in footpath...every religion teaches  peace ...but these kind of bull shits are spreading just hatred ... We must not forget that India is a country where it has variety of cultures and colours ..... and a wide variety of diversity of all the religion.....and a nation of peace .. Beta agar Muslims ka dur aa gya to phir kya hoga Ban BJP RSS Hinduo Ka vinaash nichchit Hain. Poori duniya ke Musalman ek Saath Hain...Hindu to chutiye Hain🙄 I believe in protecting what is rightfully mine.Peace is made from a position of strength.I am a Hindu and I am proud of my heritage.Jai Hind!! Much better than an &quot;anpadh Hindu nationalist &quot;,  this person is quite rational. Aukat se zada bo raha h .mn. All those people who don&#39;t see anything wrong in this video, just replace the word Muslim and Islam with Hindu and Hinduism and listen to it again. Or simply imagine a muslim man saying the same things about Hinduism. Would it still be ok? <br>The amount of hatred he has against a particular religion shows he has been brainwashed by a particular set of ideology and he does not represent an average Indian man. Any amount of hatred against anyone is wrong. 2.23 I dint find this anywhere... Stop listening to stupid videos and think that&#39;s reality Pakistani Muslims did so not Indian Muslims by the Indian Muslims r also tortured in the same <a href=\"http://way.so/\">way.So</a> don&#39;t hurt Indian Muslims.India is a secular country.All are first Indian. Hindus also do the same with Indian Muslims, many viral videos r there in YouTube and many in newspaper, so no one is good. Nahi to isse pahle to  ye dalito ko god me bithA ke rakhte the <b>KHALISTAN ZINDABAAD!</b><br><b>PAKISTAN ZINDABAAD!</b> He&#39;s each and every word is correct and the biggest truth Bas jaise hi isne kha RSS bs<br>Mai samajh gya iske dimag me gober h Har har mahadev<br>Jai hind<br>Yes the guy seems to lack knowledge about many things but the emotions he feels are common in my motherland, history has been so distorted in my mother land that somehow even talking about the sheer horror of Islamic invasions, the mass rapes and genocides the destruction of thousands of temples and building of mosques on their site, the brutal repression of Hindus until ascension of maratha empire...even mentioning these in so called secularist stages is deemed inappropriate and impolite? Why? I believe if someone had invaded Mecca and destroyed the sanctum sanatorium over there and built a church or temple over it the Muslims would never have stopped asking for justice. But we Hindus must forgo the destruction of Ram temple? Why? Why are the so called liberals and secularists so hypocritical? Who the fuck made this report ... Tell me what is gawaye e hind who are isis what is jahad in porkistan Hindu Sikh girls got kidnapped every day and forced to marry Muslims where have you been when kasmiri pamdits got killed rapped what happened with yajidis    ...<br>. stop this kind of misleading reports Insaan hain ham,religion ku khatam karge,aur duniya ku btange ik desh asa bi hain jaha insaanu ku religion sah nahi bal ka insaniyant sah jana jata ha,ju mare bai jah comments( Hindu hindutatav)par  rahe hain ,tensions mat lau bai,jeh kush time ka laye desh main gandi vayu(air) ha,jaldi band hu jayuge,aur ase band huege ka dubara kbhe es dharti par hindutatav,Islam,Christian,etc,nahi janam lahege,sab duniya janege ka sach main india main insaan rahte nah ka dharam ka tatoo,in the end jenu nah es desh ku barbaad kiya wahi desh ka mama banana chate hain,ju mere bai en dharam ka tatto ka comments par ka suchne par majbor ha ka jah desh ka kiya huga ,tensions mat lau ham ,hain ham hi en dharmu ka tatto ku unke sarre,ghali,ghandi,ghatiya such ku mukaege Chuitya ko kch malum hi nhi h Islam ke bare me Is chuitya ko kch malum hi nhi h Taking a single data point and extrapolate to whole religion....this is called as propaganda.......

We are from the south of India. Christianity and Islam bought a more even society within ourselves, without differences. Similarly mixed marriages also will in future, topple such age-old beliefs and structures. A few people who stayed on top of the food chain with their theories were eliminated. Rights to access of education and liberties to life were made available to all. Remember, Conversion came to our ancestors and land, not vice versa. <br>Any religion is followed by a person only when being part of the group gives you benefits of some sort. Benefit to access education, to marry within a certain sect of people etc. If none of these benefits exist in your religion, even you would not be following it. Why is He Not talking about Innocent Blood shed of Hindu&#39;s &amp; Muslim&#39;s in the name of Babri Masjid Bombing as everyone knows who did it actually No Were in the Bible it talk&#39;s about Stoning a Person to Death, He&#39;s Not talking about Graham Staine  &amp; His Son&#39;s Burnt alive in Orissa as Per Wadhwa Commission Report There was No Conversion was done. According to him those who Killed Graham Staine are Muslim&#39;s or Christians Bhai Ager sab duniya me log Trump ya app Jo ke rahe hai Assi soch wale log ho Jai tho Hamare future kessa <a href=\"http://hoga.jo/\">hoga.jo</a> dusro ki Jan mal ko nukssan kere us Shiksha ko mat lo. These type of people are the curse to India lo He is a fake Hindu Nationalist. F course everything is scripted to defame Hinduism Putin has no anti-muslim image, when Khabib Numragomedov won the MMA he congratulated him by going to meet him Personally so i don&#39;t believe the Fact,,,, but still their country is very far away from us they are Developed.. Indian mein bhii anti Muslim haii frbhii ghnta kch ni krrpaarhe.. Chutuiye Muslims and Christians have been ruler of India ..if there is written in their holy books to kill those who are not  Muslims and Christians.<br>Why are  you alive ? Why they didn&#39;t kill you stupid fellow? Islam ke aane se pahle duniya main development tha Kya ek innovation Bata do Islam se pahle Trump ne pahla vedeshi dora kaha ka Kiya Saudi Arabia to anti Muslim kaise huwa He talks about the violence in bible and quran. But he completely glosses over the voilence in the Hindu book of manu. Total brainwashing this man must have never ever read d bible there is nothing as such what he mentions.. when u say India majority is Hindus and there are minorities like Christian Muslim Parsis..but look at other side also today world 21st century people of any religion travel to countries of better opportunities.. Don u remember that there are Hindus in Christian majority countries like UK ,US and also IN Muslim majority countries ..this man ideology is absolutely wrong we as a country have to move forward towards prosperity not backwards and create riot scenarios ..d sooner v understand d better for our nation he criticized Muslim and Christian but promotes violence what a idiot Now go make &#39;The mind of a Muslim fundamentalist.. or lack thereof.&#39; Bhai me hindu banjaoga agar mujhay koi mujhay yeh batade ke murti poja karni hai ram bhagwan hai krishna bhagwan hai inki murti banake pujna koi bhi hai agar sucha hindu to mujhay vedoo me refrence do 4 bade books me se baatao..me hindu banjaoga..agar batadoge to agar na dhoodhpao to khud aayenay ke samnay khadke sawal karlo kya karray hum yeh aur such ki rah mein aao...vedo me likha hai bhagwan ka koi aks nai dharti me koi nahi jaanta woh kaisa hai deekhnay me magar aap apne haato se murtiya banatay usko pujtay jab ki jiski pooja karray woh khud kabhi nahi bolta ke me bhagwan hoon ram ek raja they unke andar kai achaye thi maa baap ke prati izzat thi woh deekhke log bhagwan boldiye kahaniya banaliye..baatein Kai hai jo khudku hindu bolre hindu naam ka koi dharam he nai hai..dharam sanata...bewakhufi kihaad hai apna wajhood apna naam apnay mazhab ko pehchano pehlay apni dharmik kitabe padho kabhi khool ke pata chalega such kya hai directed to hindus - we have no disdain for you, just realise that islam has been attempted to and has been successful in some cases to incessantly subjugate you, as with all other theistic cultures it encounters. Jinhoney quraan ki soorato ho theek sey parha or samjha un sab logo ney islaam kubool kiya......<br><br>Tere jese Logo ney quraan ki aayato ka galat matlab bataa kar logo ko bhatkaaya hey......<br>Islaam kabhi innocent par zulm karney ki ijaazat nahee deta. India is fucked. I met Christian families who shared some thoughts from India. Quite scary. I wonder how many will fight for freedom Basically india and Hindus never ever tried to capture any country and converted to Hindu religion.. Hindu nationalism is a wave just to protect Hindu culture in India.. We&#39;re ready to protect it at any cost. I agree with his point of view. I studied in a CSI school in Chennai where there was a blatant and consistent effort to convert students. Snack breaks in school were meant to be spent in more bible studies especially for Hindus. Non compliance meant lower marks. Hindu students were not allowed to contest in the school pupil leader elections. I respect his frankness at least he is not trying to hide his hate against Muslims but he doesn&#39;t have any knowledge about Islam and I feel sorry for him about his ignorance. He will definitely come to know the reality in hereafter life . May Allah give guidance and show the right path. But still Hindu madarchod hai I am hindu . I never say to take my religion. I never make anybody die because if someone refuses to take my religion. I fight against those who try to impose their religion on me.<br>I respect women. I am agaianst animal torture. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23IamHindu\">#IamHindu</a>. <br>And i love my hindustan <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Hindustanlovers\">#Hindustanlovers</a> mahabharat is real history not a myth. you idiots always try to defame the our culture and past. this is fake interview by this channel. it is scripted Then why Mahabharata fought and who fought that WAR MUSLIMS OR CHRISTIANS.

All the things he is saying is in mainstream media today.... Don&#39;t know if he really knows the meaning of &#39;Nationalist&#39; The title contradicts the disclaimer. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a> <br>I don&#39;t agree this<br>Since ages it&#39;s been there brother, I liked this video because it shows how much poison is in there brains.  Fucking brainwashed assholes. They bracket down nationalist as(Hindu) Sirf Islam aur Christian nahi boudh aur Sikh extemist v Hindu o ka dushman hai. As long as the Nationalists &amp; patriots are present in India, Hindustan will be Akhand and will be the world superpower and a leader nation. Jai Hind.🇮🇳 I&#39;m Christian,  I have belief in Christ but not in  people ..i won&#39;t judge you but let our God judge us... But I really appreciate you being honest. ..Bravo If these comments are what indians approve of then india is doomed. 😂😂😂😂 jahil insan . कृष्णा जो  बांसुरी बजाता था औत लडकियों को छेड़ता था, ये कैसा समाज था क्या इस्लाम था भारत में? This is the prime example of super brainwashing Ja ja ke dekh ki muslim country me kitne rapes hota hai <br><br>Mere khayal se ek bhi nahi q ki waha ka qanoon hi bahut hard hai aur bat kar rha hai tu Islam ko to tujhe study karne ki zarurat hai Islam ke bare me<br><br><br>Mujhe bahut bura laga ki India me aise bhi log rahte hai Mere bhai tu ne sahi se Islam ko nahi padha hai aur bakwas band kar teri q ki  ye desh secular country hai air is desh me galat kam nhai chalega Man, you want to me say &quot;lets fight&quot;. Fuck off A fucking dumbfuck Muje chicken pasn nhi h muje tanduri chicken psand h And yes you are defaming this person with your agenda by making this video viral.<br>Nice job He isnt wrong.  Stop criminalising such people. <br>Why dont you ask an average muslim or christian person? <br>Cant you ever criticize islam or christianity? <br>What rubbish agenda you have.<br>And you think Rahul gandhi is a good prime minister or Congress is the solution for India? I ate beef(cow meat) everyday Sala jab Hindu-Muslim ko sath me rakhna hi tha to bata hi kyu aur bhenchod jab baat hi diye the to secular banne ki kya jrurat thi, vahi pakistan ko dekhlo bhenchod, Islamic state of Pakistan, Aur hum hindu muslim sikh isai sab bhai, to   Pakistanio ka dna yaha k muslimo se alag tha kya?? India ko ye Congressi bhenchod apne baap ki jagir samajhte rahe madharchod sale. It is <b>The mind of sanghi nationalist</b> Save Hinduism from Congress.. Its quite tough to understand whats wrong with peoole like u.... Islamist spreading islam in name of jihad fine... But if a hindu stands for his religion... He becomes hindu nationalist,, why!! Middle class hindu people know the situation of Indian geo politics better than anyone because of continuous attacks by muslims and christians on their culture and survival. Branewashed I am a hindu nationalist... not fake or pseudo secular This man does not know religion Diplomat channel.. trying desperately to show bias against him.... at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m47s\">3:47</a> you show a map which is completely wrong. Religious violence is more in west and middle east...lol... that&#39;s some blatant propaganda you tried to pull. And about new Zealand shooting, who was that? A hindu<br>Or Christian Bible apostles ne likhi thi constantine ne nahi constantine pehla raja tha jisne Christianity ko recognition diya yahi hota hai jab aap history ki kitabein chod k Golwalkar padhne lagte hain If as religion Hinduism is fever, Christianity is flu, then Islam is brain cancer ! I am an athiest. And I do consider Islam more as an illness than a religion. 12 class tak main kuch zyada hi secular tha. Fir sachchai pata chali Islam ke bare mein. Islam aur Christianity dono Bharatvarsh ki pehchan ke dushman hain. Islam to bilkul bhi allow nahi hona chahiye. Ye sab nautanki hai Saudi arab ki Pure illetrate bro.keep it up😂😂😂 Either a person can be religious or secular .If a person is liberal in true sense then he will have love and  pain in his heart for all human being no matters to which religion ,caste or Creed he belongs. And if a person is religious in true sense then he will have hate in his heart for other religions and religious people. If anyone of  you who is calling him or hersef liberal and despite of saying this  you consider it sin to eat,meet, and marriage with other casts,creeds and religious people then remember that you are not liberal in true sense. Religion is one of those ideas which harmed human being. All religions of today&#39;s world posses an extent of heater and intolerance regarding to other religions or non religious people. Aur koi chutiya nai Mila kya Yeh aadmi kitna chutiya hai Chkee woh nhi jo market m hote h chake toh woh h joh bc hindu hone k baad bhi hindu ka saath na de or uske khilaaf bole The religious part is completely wrong about chistainity....<br>You are talking about Judaism. Bass yehi Walla nasha karna hai🙄😂😂😂 Pahle isko jail bhejo ! Gaye ka mutar syrup peene aur  patanjali k gobar k biscuits khane k bad log aisi hi baten kerte hain. Lund ki pooja kr skte ho choot ki.pooja kr sakte ho. Taras ata hai tum jaise logo per. Jhoooota insaaaan So you are trying to show that every hindu has this mindset. Ye hai rss A.K.A BHAKTS Just to clarify this but that verse which he quoted from the bible was in the old testament and after the death of Jesus it changed.... Even I don&#39;t believe that much in christianity I agree with him, but if we look back at every religion there&#39;s always something about being stoned to death, executed, prosecuted but it&#39;s up to humanity how they&#39;d take that understanding.... If they had preached more about love in the past I assure you things should have changed a long time ago.... In Islam women are protected by wearing burqa.  Islam never allows   harassment on women😒😒. Rape cases mostly happen in India  on Hindu teenager girls. Name me any single Islamic country where Muslim girls are raped??  In Islam woman are allowed to get education without restrictions. ISIS is not part of Islam which rejects woman education.  You can watch mala yusufzai speech on women rights in Islam.Alhumdulillah,<br>I&#39;m always proud of Muslim and I always support woman rights 😒 I am an atheist but the one thing he gets right is that the root of all modern problems is monotheism . Christianity and Judaism have caused so many conflicts throughout their history .And don&#39;t get me started on &quot;The religion of peace &quot; ,it&#39;s the most bullshit ideology ever. Matlab kuch bhi 😂 Title of this video is absurd Funny thing Is, as the kjb party came in to power,  more cow have been sold and exported to be slaughtered from India pati k marne pr patni ko aagdhan krna bhi islam ne hi sikhayaa hougaa.<br>bible kis aur nhi jesus christ he ne likhi thi <br>Constantinople ne bas uska anoud kiya thaa from greek to english and made some changes and corrupted the bibble <br>this man is a lier and taking totally nonsense FACTS. The mind of a average Hindu who&#39;s talking the truth. Just look at the past 800 years of Bharat history. Most people dont know about Hindu holocaust. Sad to see so many educated fellow citizens with such a poor point of view.. This guy is simply promoting terrorism.. What an ignorant brainwashed person. The Chapter 9 which he is taking about is regarding the war and treaty with idolaters. That is fight with those who do not fullfil the treaty and protect those who mean no harm to you. <br>Quran 9:4-5<br>&quot;(But the treaties are) not dissolved with those pagans with whom Ye have entered into alliance and who have not subsequently failed you in aught, nor aided anyone against you. So fulfil your engagements with them to the end of their term: for Allah loveth the righteous. (4)<br>Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. (5) With such comments,  let&#39;s see the future of our nation चाय पर चर्चा करते करते भाई सहाब ने असलियत बयां करदी वो भी इतना ज्ञान के साथ 🙏 सैकुलर लोग यही असलियत है 😊 आप समझ जाओ | You Mean Hinduism Is Peaceful Religion 😂😂😂😂😂 Joke Of The Earth Diplomat is chutiya anti Hindu. Which &quot;scholar&quot; says Mahabharat is NOT matriarchal? Bloody chutiyas don&#39;t have one female pope and go around teaching us. 🏜️  cults Hahahha soo happy to see this..<br>Aur bolo indian muslims.. khush hoo? Hahahahha<br>Just wait for BJP to come in power again and they will force u to convert to hinduism.. goodluck I support this guy..  He is right looks like some people are hating this video Idiot does not know what&#39;s written and claims and spread wrong information... ask him to learn or read least to go on media to spread right information. Aarey kamine foreign media can not understand this, indian political issues and ground problems are very different from other countries. I can clearly see the honesty in this man&#39;s mind and his words and expression In last 70 years the biggest Corruption in India is &quot;Secularism&quot;... Disgusting , Rss ki kitaaabe phdnaaa bnd kr dooo Brain wash kr Diya hae in ka..<br>Bhai present ki baaat kro or India ki baaat kro We are fighting from 1000 years from an ideology who kills others and don&#39;t listen to anybpdy<br>Have u tried a mind of a muslim extrimist ? <br>No ofcourse not u wouldn&#39;t be alive by now “Allah!

There is no truth in the verses he delivered from Quran and Bible.  Bhakto aankhen kholo. Yah khel h politics ka. Bus paisa paisa. Air kuch nahi.

Aaj tum log jo musalmano ke sath kar rahe ho uska hisab tumhere aane Wali generation ko Dena hoga. So jo Karo soch Samaj kar karo Allah ne Quran mai saaf Bola hai, kisi be gunah ko nhi maro, apne padosi ko bhi nahi pareshan Karo, kisi ke religion ko bura na bolo. Islam bahut peace wala religion hai. Agar Islam ko manane wala galat kaam Kare toh Islam kaise kharab Hu, insan kharab hona chahiye.. Aaj bhgwa terrorist ghum rahe Gali mohalle mai, toh Kya hindu dharm kharab ho gaya? Nhi aisa nhi hota.. Generelize Kyu karte ho bhai mere.

Chutiya If he needs medical advice he would visit an expert called a medical doctor. Whey is he himself interpreting the verses of Quran. Doesn&#39;t he need to see an expert of Islam called and Islamic Scholar? This man and men like him need to learn something called &#39;Context&#39; and talk withing the bounds of the awesome word. You guys agree with this, but hindu nationalist India is no place for someone with other religions. Already you see religious minorities taking up all the slums not having a chance to be successful This Man knows nothing about the bible, how it was written and he is even making up stories about stoning someone to death if he doesn&#39;t accept Christianity. This Verse is in the Old Testament,  and was For the people of the time who were Barbaric,  it is History, and is not applicable nor followed by any Christian, Jesus taught us Peace and this peace was learnt by Mahatma Gandhi, when he met Martin Luther King in South Africa..these Teaching of Peace and Non Violence by Jesus Christ was the main instrument that gave India it&#39;s freedom..Christian&#39;s are the most peaceful people on the planet..the problem is people do not know the difference between Christian&#39;s and Other Sects that profess to be Christian&#39;s.. This Man is one of those people who are brought up on lies and they believe it as the truth and spread hatred, ......No Christian will ever Stone anyone to death or even force anyone to become a Christian....yes People heart will get converted after they read the Holy Bible and they learn how to Love all Humans by the teachings of Jesus Christ...Not the religion but yes everyone who reads heart gets converted..... This is the reason why north India is...... U blaiming Hindu nationalism  , what u forgot what the UPA govt done in 10 year by appeasing Muslims , that&#39;s what lots of dissatisfaction arose in the mind of Hindu&#39;s . I love Muslim shikh. Christian and all religion&#39;s . Droupathi was sold as a commodity in gambling He spoke very clearly...but, u can not show it as a countries stand or opinion Kya hindu muslim ye sab bakchodi hai.. &#39;ye gormint humko pagal bana rahi h&#39; just chill karo.. muslim k ghar pe biryani khao aur hindu k ghar me diwali manao.. Bhaiiyon ki tarah raho ek dusre ka culture celebrate karo. Ek life h mast rho kaam karo successful bano kya ye chutiyapanti h ek dusre ko critisize krne ka run Hindu, nationalist, proud. Bhai Shahab history padkar aao bad m interview Dena aur apna mat Janta Ko Dena mahila pardhan samaj only Sindhu ghati sabhyata m tha jab se aaryo ka Bharat m aagman hua aur wo apni manuwadi soch lekar aaye tab se Bharat na to sone ki chidiya rha uske bad hi India ka vinash hona shuru ho gya Psychopath asshole. And I can see more assholes coming in his support. None of his point was incorrect. Absolutely true All bull shit..so u guys want us to follow Hinduism so that we can stay in India? Best of luck but i guarantee u will fail little knowledge is dangerous So.pity thinking Dumbass... 🤣🤣🤣🤣   ok  Study Hinduism and must  read about cast ism or  women Rights.I prayer Indian select again Modi they deserve Nationalism. Can u pls ask the same question s to a muslims what they think a out hindus upload a diplomatic answers not ask go avrg persons Kuch bhi bolra bhai apna This video is perfect example of BJP showing it&#39;s true colours... They are ignorant and practise radicalism. <br><br>Get your facts right!<br><br>Constantine never wrote the Bible. The books in the Bible are named by their authors, and all books were written in the 1st century itself, before 200 years of Constantine. <br><br>Where does the Bible speak of punishing unbelievers? On the contrary we are told to love them.<br><br>The second is this: &#39;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#39; There is no other commandment greater than these.&quot;\\r<br>Mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=12m31s\">12:31</a> ESV<br><br>Here neighbour means the person sitting next to you. Well I belong to a Christian family and I&#39;m an Atheist.<br>I&#39;ve never read or learnt anything like this or seen anyone saying or doing something like this.<br>This is called extremism and these people are taught to be extreme.<br>Unity in diversity is our country&#39;s strength and we should never forget it. People here talk of being a proud hindu nationalist but still don&#39;t address the skeleton within the closet which is caste-ism which is more complex than racism..sab muslim/christians ko bhaga denge ..fir bachenge apne caste pe chaati peetne waale hindu log This guy&#39;s is mad I love each 1 religion either u ma be Hindi Christine r Muslims etc 4 me God is 1 The Mind of Bhakt It&#39;s time to rise..... Learn from our mistakes.... We due to our kind heart/pity &amp; plegdes(usool) are what we are now.....Now It&#39;s not the time to show pity &amp; fight against wrong..... Alright fuck religion. I am an atheist now. Why have you titled it as Hindu nationalist? He is an average person. He is the real public. His idea about the other religions scripture is entirely wrong..he knows nothing about other religions...Constantine wrote the Bible😁? Joty tum logo ko kuch bi Pata bus bakwas kr lo Gave a dislike because it is blatant that this video is for the purpose of creating hinduphobia. Has he lost his mind. Kuch bhi bolra h be Islam hota kya h pta bhi jahil gawar anpadh jake pehle padhle fir bakwass karna ase log ko to jute marke jail mi band kar dena chahiye. If you really hate christians and muslims then why even trade with them? Why even buy oils from muslim countries? Why even want US protection and other christian countries? Ride a bicycle, use cowdung use all indian properties but not foreign goods😄 Well truly during 1984 Sikhs were killed by hindus and that too from UP, why is it that secularism is bashed, it literally means that religion should stay out of politics, if religion is out of politics no one can use it for votes like bjp. वीडियो में जानकारी गलत थी इसलिए सही जानकारी देना जरूरी है।<br>सरस्वती शिशु मंदिर का संचालन राष्ट्रीय स्वयंसेवक संघ RSS द्वारा नही किया जाता है। इसके लिए अलग अलग समिति है। सामान्यतः यह समितियां किसी भी सामान्य नाम से पंजीकृत होती है। प्रारम्भ में विद्या भारती के रूप यह अभी जाना जाता है। आज के समय मे इसका 100 साल का इतिहास है, जिसको देश की आजादी के बाद संस्थागत रूप से शुरू किया गया। इसके बाद जब पहली बार गैर कांग्रेसी सरकार बनी तब इसे और मजबूती मिली थी। Someone might have a misconception. To spread half knowledge of a person who is again not an influential persona is inappropriate for this channel and the person behind this content. I can simply suggest - Grow Up Chutiye Yea if you learn Islam from RSS... Dropdi ka cheer haran kisne kya Before deciding on other religions, you must know exactly about those religions. The basic purpose of all religions is peace.  But some people not understanding it. And some people using it political benefits.<br><br>If you want to know about Islam and Muslim, then go to Saudi Arabia (ksa, uae) not in rss camp or Pakistan. Jai hind In jaise chutiyon ki wajah se hamara Desh Abhi bhi bahut peeche hai aur inn Ko roka nahi Gaya toh Desh ke aur bhi tukhde ho jayenge. Agar har gali me masjid hai toh har masjid ke bagal me aap Ko ek Mandir zaroor milega. Chutiyon se kaho ki ek baap dada toh Desh ke tukhde kar ke chale gaye, Kam se Kam aane wali generation Ko peace se rehne de. Long live India Time will tell who will win ... meanwhile you can keep on drinking gao mata piss 😁 wow hes a real intellect and a Genius... HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA salute to you stupid.

Just reading the comments and it&#39;s not hard to assume the future of my nation ! Pseudo-intellectual nerds and left wing idiots giving lectures to Hindus on tolerance. Wow... There is nothing written in Bible to stone your brother if he is not Christian... It&#39;s very funny how people can speak rubbish with such confidence.. Kutta jhuta chalag karta hon tm nay sb joot bola Brainwash What’s wrong when Islam is spreading like street dogs and spreading hatred against Hindus <br>Quran says only allah is god and everyone else is enemy and same is being taught in their schools JIHAD and Allah hu akbar <br>What is wrong if y want to preserve ur religion <br>What is wrong if other community marries five wife’s and spreads its religion to become majority in world and crush other religion <br>We are born to follow our ethics morals and preserve them 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 One second I really don&#39;t understand the comment section, kindly do point out one statement he said wrong? the is defining the current sentiments of Hindus is that so wrong? are we supposed to be so blind and dumb and always be so politically correct to the minority ? ok so also let me know the status of minorities in Muslim countries and then maybe we can have an argument Aisa choothiyon kka wajah se......GITA karke ek book ka bhi badnaam ho rahA hein.....

Speaking on all the rights and all these things do you understand how little he know about other religions of the country,how little they know about their ideology apart from some twisted or vague understanding of it. I say that with little knowledge there is a lot of danger to others . Lastly if Christian&#39;s and Muslims are the one whose holy book invokes violence on the non believers then who are beating them up for accusations?? Violence for violence ,is it a Hindu teaching ? I dont think so .  The other religions mentioned above dont invoke this. In which verse is it written in bible,stone to death to the nonbelivers????please answer my question,i think your not much capable of going through bible,,,,so please be aware even in other fields,,,Becouse there is a saying &quot;little knowledge is dangerous&quot;.hope you ll take it positively.

Who the fuck is Ramzan Kadyrov<br><br>Fuck off BOBS and Vegana Maar Bc ko Ye chutiyaa h Bc..... <br>GANDHI followed GANDHI Completely wrong information on Christianity and there is no such verse like this in the Bible which this guy quoted. Interesting true i support you Bible wasn&#39;t written by Constantine and second thing that there is nowhere in the entire Bible where it&#39;s written to kill anyone who does not believe in Christianity. <br>In Bible it&#39;s stated that if anyone worships any God (be it Lord Shiva or any other God) then let him do so without any sort of interference.<br><br>I guess the man in the video has been misled and is confused about his knowledge regarding Christianity and all. &#39;Manu Smriti&#39;, a sacred Hindu text, on how &#39;shudras&#39; (people of the &#39;lowest caste&#39;) should be treated:<br><br>1. &#39;A Shudra who insults a twice born man (i.e &#39;an upper caste&#39; man) with gross invectives SHALL HAVE HIS TONGUE CUT OUT; for he is of LOW origin&#39;\\xa0(Manu VIII. 270.)<br><br>2. &#39;If he (the shudra) mentions the names and castes of the (twice born) with contumely, AN IRON NAIL, TEN FINGERS LONG, SHALL BE THRUST RED HOT INTO HIS MOUTH.&#39;\\xa0(Manu VIII. 271.)<br><br>3. &#39;If a Shudra arrogantly presumes to preach religion to Brahmins, the king shall have POURED BURNING OIL IN HIS MOUTH AND EARS.&#39; (Manu VIII. 272.)<br><br>4. &#39;No Shudra should have property of his own. He should have NOTHING of his own. The existence of a wealthy Shudra is bad for the Brahmins. A Brahman may take possession of the goods of a Shudra.&#39; (ManuVIII-417 &amp; X129)<br><br>5. &#39;The most sacred duty of a Shudra is to SERVE THE BRAHMINS, always, reciting the words &quot;Brahman&quot; with utmost devotion. Such a Shudra will get salvation. OTHERWISE HE WILL DIE A WORST DEATH AND WILL GO TO THE WORST HELL.&#39; (Manu X-121)<br><br>6. &#39;A Brahmin can order a Shudra to serve him without any remuneration because the Shudra is created by Brahma to serve the Brahmins. Even if a Brahmin frees a Shudra from slavery the SHUDRA CONTINUES TO BE A SLAVE AS HE IS CREATED FOR SLAVERY. Nobody has the right to free him.&#39; (Manu VIII-50,56 and 59)<br><br>7. &#39;A Shudra is UNFIT TO RECEIVE EDUCATION. The upper varnas should not impart education or give advice to a Shudra. It is not necessary that the Shudra should know the laws and codes and hence need not be taught. Violators will go to as amrita hell. (Manu IV-78 to 81)<br><br>This text is STILL followed in India. The &#39;caste system&#39; that was born out of this book STILL exists. The Shudras STILL can&#39;t marry &#39;upper caste&#39; Hindus. They STILL can&#39;t be &#39;equal&#39; to their &#39;caste masters&#39;. For FIVE THOUSAND years, the Shudras tolerated this terrorism. The longest-running persecution in history. But, you never hear of it.. And Hindutva terrorists are so busy meticulously researching other religions that they never find the time to study their own. So what everybody is basically implying is that just cause I am a Muslim and my entire family has been Muslim and we migrated from Pakistan in order to be a part of India decades ago, we shouldn&#39;t be given any rights and should rather be driven out? A very interesting trend nowadays. Only if half you actually had the time to comprehend the Books of religion rather than read, India probably wouldn&#39;t have been in this situation in the first place. Nevertheless I&#39;ve always been an Indian and will be proud of it whether I live here or die somewhere else. Read Jewish bible, if you want to talk about Christianity and Jesus wasn&#39;t declared as son of god in 1300, again Read Jewish bible for that. Tabtoh hathiyaar uthana hi parega 👏 I dont totally disagree with him.... He is telling the reality..no doubt some parts of his speech is not acceptable..but most of the things are truth... And also Statistics shown here is biased.... He is telling truth..why the title is soo anti hindu? I&#39;m loosing faith in Islam after watching Zakir Naik. Saraswati shishu mandir = madrasa<br>RSS = small time isis I can say ye पढ़ा लिखा जाहिल है Such an ignorant about Islam I am into saving the nation and it&#39;s democracy too, but by following the principles of Hinduism! My religion is not so small that it can be attacked by anyone without any consequences! My religion is open to thoughts, My religion is an ideology which can&#39;t be killed! It was never in threat! Fear is just a political tool brought before every election by our respected politicians. We are told Hinduism is in danger, Dalits are being told they are in danger, Muslims are being told they are in danger. Politicians want to keep this fear alive in all of us just for their benefits. My Shrimadh Bhagvadh Geeta has taught be to be free from irrational fears and to have faith in the divine! I won&#39;t fall for some words from some mere human who just want to create a divide to satisfy their personal motives!<br>Everyone needs to understand this...Only when we will be free from fear will we give rise to a good governance and stability in our country!<br>Above all Lord Krishna has told us that humanity is above everything! If Islam and Christianity is evil,then for what the hell these guys migrating to muslim and Christian majority countries for better jobs Why world hate Islam?? All world and every religion?? Because they are really evil,  proven cancer of the world! Being a hindu nationalist is much better than being a islamic terrorist...<br>Madarchod doglapan dekho inka...Ek radical hindu sirf strong language use krta hai to wo galat hai lekin jab mulla bhen ka loda jihad k naam pe mass murder kr k chla jata hai to uska loda chuste hain ye....Tumhari maa ka bhosda barkha dutt type k logo Quran surah tauba verse -5 makka me atheist ne muslims k gharo ko loota unki maa behano ko uthaya verse-7 allah ne muslimo ko hukam diya ki apne haq k liye ladho apni maa behano k liye jihaad karo verse -9 jo dushman tmse panah maange usko na sirf panah do balki usko esi jagah chodh kr aao jaha usko koi nuksaan na pohcha sake.....is insaan ne jo chai pee thi usme zarur ganja mila tha😂😂😂 india will divide again .khalistan kashmir nagaland assam bihar tripura nagaland mazoram sikkam will be liberated.

Bhai ka Janam Pakistan rishtedar Punjabi Sasural Lucknow wah Islam mazhab aman (peace)  ka mazhab hai. Agar koyi ladki ko pareshan krta hai toh islamic shariah mai ous ko bohat badi saza diyi jati hai for example agar kisi nai chori kiyi ous ke donu hath kaat dalte hai. Humare Prophet Muhammad (saw) ne farmaya ki agar meri beti chori kare toh ous ke hath kaat dena. India mai rape is liye zyada ho rhe hai kyu ki otni badi saza toh nhi hai yaha par. Mgr muslim countries mai oun ko sedha mar degay jo rape karte hai. Is ke baad koyi bhi himat nhi krta rape krne ki. Bakchodi Kar raha hai sala....tum Jaise chutiye is desh ko barbaad Kar diya hai I am a Kashmiri Pandit and I approve this message. If the Journalists, News media and Press was even half as truthful as this Gentleman in this video, we would have a different kind of India. Hats off to this guy. I amazed how an ordinary guy can be this well versed. Bhai bhaut sahi..,.....<br> jaat sani Hui h ye katvo ki Inka Islam sana hua h bc one day India will be 0% Muslim country Our tolerance broke us in Pakistan and India. We&#39;ve to rise now I agree to this guy. My friend got married with his lover who is Muslim under one condition that he should get converted to Muslim. I may agree on many points, but atleast not on taking the law in own hands or the Cow meat related case. This guy is absolutely right. Muslims jahaan minority mein hotey hain, wahaan &quot;bhaichaara bhaichaara&quot; chillatey hain. Jahan majority mein hotey hain wahan gundaagardi. Kafir momino ka kuch nh bigad sakhtay. Allah nay kafiron k dilo m musalmano ka khof dala huwa hai. Islam i bura bolra Teri salle kute ki aulad Teri surat hi dekga rahi hai k iya hai tu oh yaar yeah bjp ka supportor hai kyoun hai yaar yeah kaha se aya hai ye to dangayi hai inka koi dharam nahi hota ye adharm log hai Hamari sunwai hoti hai ka translation &#39;our voice is heard&#39; ye hai. Na ki influence as stated. The Democrat lied in the video and in translation as well. This channel hasn&#39;t read  any verses of quran or bible and saying this man is wrong...👏👏👏 he has learn from the experience which these channels hasn&#39;t heard...and people says that reporter&#39;s are telling the truth😂😂😂lol Constantine wrote the Bible ? Lol , he was an emperor that&#39;s just all. Please, don&#39;t speak bullshit. I understand that you hate that religion but don&#39;t talk lies. Deuteronomy is a Jewish scripture and not that of Jesus&#39; scripture (Gospel). The only solution is then take this whole reservation system down based on Relegion,Cast,Race,Sex and provide reservation only for economically backward classes and Person with disabilities and for Scheduled Tribes.<br><br>The Age descrimination is a joke of this century.Age limit should be same for any exams irrespective of the Cast.<br>Gen has maximum age limit 28 and other categories has 5+ years more than the General.If there is a need of justification then it should be based on the application fees or registration fees not on cast , religioun or age.<br>India is a developing country ,so it should take out unnecessary reservations.<br><br>!!!!!!! Age limit for any job application or exam should be same irrespective of the category he or she belongs,if it takes time to take down the whole reservation system down !!!!!!!!<br><br>And the govt system should take the maximum age limit for a fresh post should be 28. Not more than that.<br>India need young generation to lead the country.<br>And reservation should be given area wise also if needed.<br>Statewise reservation is a good idea giving 70% jobs to the state resident or having born in that state.<br>It&#39;s any way better than all this reservation based on category ,age,sex,cast <br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23JaagoIndiaJaago\">#JaagoIndiaJaago</a> Hindu and proud. Lol thats why his people get thrown out from Gujarat and Maharashtra for his cheap thinking.. This guy is 100% right India has the 2 nd largest muslim population so its rank  4 th in religious violence is very obvious.. Hindus are always casualties of peace. Its time for dhramyayuddhya.. Seems like this fool never did his independent research, he said bible was written by Constantine! seriously? Most of the knowledge he expressed is what he heard from RSS and BJP.  Women oppression is not derived from islam, it is part hindu religion you idiot. For god sake  somebody educate these fools. This guy is a anti national, a shame to India. Centuries of Mughal n British rule in India didnt pose any threat to Hindus in India but all of a sudden after 2014 all Hindus in an Independent nation are in danger 😂😂😂. Dikhaawe pr mat jao...apni akal lagaao. Cow meat is protein and multiple gods is bullshit because there is only one god. You family should have accepted Islam beacause this religion is better than yours. Too much racism and casteism , wonder how YouTube gonna handle these videos in future this man is not human offcource pork Yeh such khatra hain and you expect India to get better 😂 What  Aakash Bhatia says about Islam  may be  true. But he is completely wrong about Christianity. The mainstay of Christian doctrine is the New Testament which is devoid of any verse exhorting Christians to commit acts of violence.Nowhere in the world can you find a Christian group beheading Christian apostates, or stoning adulterous women or mowing down children under a truck or beheading non-Christian priests in their places of worship all in the name of Christianity.  Even in India where Christianity is in existence since 53 AD, there has been no incidence of riots between Hindus and Christians in these nearly 2000 years, even in states like Goa and Kerala where Christians number more than 25% of the total population.<br>    The Old Testament does contain some verses exhorting Jews to commit acts of violence such as the Amelakites. But today there are no Amelakites any where in the world and so those verses have lost their relevance.  Besides, you don&#39;t hear any Jew committing acts of violence against non-Jews because of their non-Jewish religion. Aakash Bhatia is just a  nincompoop trying to pass off as a great scholar creating  ill will among different communities.<br> I would like to tell Aakash Bhatia that I am a Christian and my family of 4 members consists of one Hindu living with me under one single roof. This guy is a dumb..😂😂 Drapthi ka cherharan hua ha u think he has fogotten it He makes more sense than all the Indian leftists combined for all those who take the sword will die by the sword .. god is supreme doesnt need any human to protect any religion we all live in disguise may lord protect our nation ... No doubt that Quran and Bible is fucked up. I will always be against these religions for that. But, had the &quot;Hindu&quot; ever read &quot;manusmriti.&quot; How different is it? Bas Kar yar kitna badnam karega islam Ko khudki mazhab ka phela Panna KY he a nehi malum our Islam ka hawala de rahahe Pakistan  completed killing  of Hindus,  now nothing left, so they don&#39;t figure , what a analysis Most of the comments below video are awesome here. Yes, the man is right and though the claims are unsubstantiated (in literature), they are happening and so he is correct. Perhaps its a misrepresentation, by the respective community leaders, of their own religious books and practices....but he is correct. Its happening. Emotions, especially if it is same in large community, are like volcanoes. You create unjustified pressure, it will explode and the resultant lava will burn where it will flow.<br><br>Hence please start respecting all religion. Neither treat the  people from any other religion as &quot;inferior&quot; or &quot;sinner&quot; and do not pity him from your religious upbringing spectacles and hence try to save him by conversion. If you want to save him, fight for his right to practice his  own faith or help him in humanitarian way... Time has come now.. Hidutva jaag jao wrna Khatam ho jaoge.  support Modi ..its a request Poor guy, he is a little uneducated, but he and his family has gone through a lot. One can understand his hate against the religion. He clearly does not hate Muslims, just the religion. &quot;Christianity and islam&quot; does not originate from india<br>Just foreign influence and invasion This Bastard might have been drunk saying: &quot;Hindus are good and Muslims are bad&quot; whereas the reality is totally opposite as &quot;Hindus are the worst extremists and Islam is the most peace loving religion - Alhamdullilah&quot; Abey  oh  jhoot  bolna  hi  hai  to  bhai  sahee  se  bolo  ye  kia  aadhi  baat  batayi  aur  aadhi  chupa  li,  surah  at tawba mai  likha  hai  ke  maaro  mushrikeen  ko  jaha  bhi  tumhe  mile ( verse 5) , mushrikeen  aur  kaafir  mai  difference  hai  kiunke  kaafir  to  vo  hai  jo khul  ke kahe  ke  mai  nhi  maanta  Islam  ko  aur  mushrik  vo  hai  jo  kahe ke  mai  musalman  houn  likin andar  se  vo  musalman  na  ho aur  dhoka  dene  aur  nuksaan  pohanchane  ke  liye  jhoot  bol kr  kisi  musalman  ke  saath  rhe,  aur  ye  parh  liya  ke maarne  ke  baare  mai  likha  hai  likin  usi  surah  ke  next  verse  ko  nhi  parha jis  mai  likha  hai  ke agr  vo  tumse  dhoka  dene  ke  liye  maafi  maange  to  unko  chor  do  aur  koi  nuqsaan  na  pohanchayo kiunke  Allah  maaf krne  valo  ko  pasand  krta  hai Normal person he seems to right Islam ane se pehle widhwa ko jalaya jata tha He accepted corruption Abhi b hai Toxic Indians enters the chat * Prithvi raj chuhan  kio dusre raja ki larki utha kar le kar geya Guru govind singh ji ne julam ko khatam karne ke liye hathiyar uthaya hindu muslim ko marne ke liye nahi ab hindu atankvadi hai Chutiye masjid donation k paise se bnti hain....smja 2000 sala phaila India me sirf randdee pan hota Aur paida hua baccha ku zinda dafan karta tha Hindu&#39;s....

Aise hindu ka Gala kaatne mei Mujhe badha anand aayega 😂....  Half knowledge leads to destruction... This guy is only spreading hatred between hindus and muslims.

Apni galtiya chupaooo aur sab Islam pe daal do , Jo anti Muslim ho bas Inka vote unhi ko jaayega , baaki desh jaaye bhaad mey !!!!! From the comments it appears that people are jealous of Islam and have become frustrated and suffer from inferiority complex. That&#39;s why these persons won&#39;t be able to think rational. Galat Kya Kahan yeh batao Putin is not anti muslim islam is one of their tradictional religion after orthodox christianism tipical ilitirate indian so sad Bro do you actually know what religion is?? Because this kind of thinking actually spread hatred,.... The main problem with is you cannot accept any other religions(as a matter of respect for others)...and being a citizen of secular democratic country you should see people regarding their noble deeds as human beings,,not in a religious viewpoint.. RSS CORRUPTS UR BRAIN N VISION I am a proud Muslim<br>A proud Indian<br>Jai hind jai Bharat<br>But if you say that my religion is making any kind of isuue in my country then I would like to say &quot; sir there are black sheep&#39;s in every community &quot; I have many friend who are not Muslim my best friend is Vishal and you know like my family loves him more then me and same is the case from other side .. I don&#39;t know about the political situations in my country because I am fed up with both Congress and BJP both are making us fool taking high amount of texes from us and giving us Hindu Muslim fights .. I hope and I wish 1 day we all will understand from both the sides that peace is the only solution and man THATS WHAT MAKES  US  INDIA.. rape karne wala 90% non-muslim, victim  non-muslim phir bhi iski wajah hum musalman wah kia logic hai may allah bless u and giv u hidayah (the right path ) brother  bhai agr tum kehte ki tum musalmaan ke khilaf ho to me tumari baat sehmat tha lekin tumne kaha ki tum islam ke khilaf  ho aur bhai jo tumne surah tawbah ki ayat batai wo correct hai wo ayat jab launch hui thi jab ek war chal raha tha ab tumhi batao ki duniya me konsa army ka commandr hoga jo apne logo ko bolega ki maaro mat mar kha lo jung ke doraan ? aur bhai kia tumne agli ayat nhi padhi jisme saaf likha hua hai ki  &quot; aur agr un kaafiro me koi nhi ladna chah raha hai to use shelter do use protect karo &quot; pls bhai nafrat mat phelao agr quran samajh nhi aati to kisi maulana ke paas jaakr apne doubts pucho bhai As an atheist I can say he has a good argument This is what poor education gives u... The quran mentions sabians as people who should be protected in islam  Hindus are actually considered sabians in our religion. We were never told to kill Hindus. Or anyone in that matter . The mention of &quot;polytheist religion &quot; is the the mention of Iranian pre islamic religions in middle East Zoroastrianism,\\xa0Mithraismand\\xa0Manichaeism. These religions are known to be violent and non abiding to rules and regulations and against humanity . ( killing unborn female children ,cutting the penis of as a sacrifice, drinking blood and making statues of spiritual deities out of human bones ) these are the religion the Qur&#39;an in against and ideas commanded to kill them because they didn&#39;t understand nor did they let new muslims who are the companions of Muhammad sws follow their religion  and were also thrown out of their city . It was out of revenge just like the man said, if you can&#39;t keep peace with words then seek peace with weapons . Hinduism is not a nemesis ,opponent of rival to our religion but we rather in arab countries such as the UAE respect them . Anyone saying otherwise I shall give you the correct verse <br><br>Indeed, those who\\xa0believe,\\xa0and\\xa0those who are\\xa0Jews, and the Christians and the Sabians, any who believe in God and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.&quot;[Quran 2:62]<br>&quot;Indeed, those who\\xa0believe, and those who are\\xa0Jews, and the Sabians and the Christians, any who believe in God and the Last Day, and work righteousness,- on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.&quot;[Quran 5:69] Hahaha Quran Ko Galt samaj Raha hai ya log Thought I will see an extremist but no. He was well balanced. Good job Diplomat, but don&#39;t agree with the &#39;unsubstantiated claims&#39; disclaimer for everything he says. Once i was traveling a guy set beside me our chat started with simple weather which was cold than we talked about raising family to our love life dramas after one hour of great talk he asked if i have water i gaved him the bottle while drinking he said &quot;bhai aap ne apna naam to bataya nahi&quot; when i told him mine name he spited the water out of the window looked at me with anger took his bags and set on a diffrent seat and said main kather hindu hu tum jaiso ke baju me nahi baitha the movement he said that i got call from my father while talking on phone some guy stoped the bus and started asking who spited the water out as it hited one of them they ware like 8-9 guys on diffrent bikes the started beating conductor he told who it was they started beating him too everybody was horribly calm and i dont know why but it cracked my heart i stood and started shouting ek adami ko itne log mar rahe ho thik hai galati huwi khatam baat than every one else also stood up one buy one after seeing this the guys ran away no body was ready to take the guy to hospital he was bleeding badly as they might getting in legal trouble i stood him up stoped an auto he was fainting auto was not ready as i told him i will pay double he took me to hospital i contacted his family i waited till they arrived as i was leaving he called me in as i went there he started crying and said &quot;bhai mujhe maaf kerdo yar allah ke waste maaf kardo&quot; i replied bhagwan ke waste aap apna khayal rakho ... Personally phone kr diya krte hein* saste nashe Bharat bn rha tha* dislikes are for that title of this video.......DAMN....this man is speaking 100% truth. some liberals, peacefuls, ricebag converts , pseudo seculars might disagree with him, but what he is saying is 100% true.... This guy is so very right. What do all the countries with the most religious unrest have in common ? I&#39;ll wait for you to figure it out Well whatever he said is truth , just showing some articles / assumptions or words from some people after his wording to prove him wrong won&#39;t make him actually wrong. Librals hindu humareh hindustan khatam karne par tula hain Actually ithink hindus  dont have knowledge about muslims .ill educated peoples How dare you saying yourself nationalist.

When people start learning a religion in the context of politics without thoroughly reading the scriptures with context then comes IGNORANCE Keep dreaming you fools not even one person from RSS had fought for freedom you assholes only know to take about religion not a bit of developing shameless This guy is dumb. He is talking about Quran and saying it&#39;s Christianity. Ignorant boy. You need to research rather than just listening to few radicals and having negative opinions. बहुत बढ़िया भाई साहब राम राम जय श्री राम The word\\xa0Hindu\\xa0is derived from the Sanskrit word\\xa0Sindhu\\xa0which is the local name for the Indus River that flows through the north-western part of the Indian subcontinent. Sindhu also means sea. The word Hindu or Indu was used by Greeks to denote the country and people living beyond the Indus river. Megasthenes&#39; &#39;Indica&#39; epitomizes the name for India and Indians around the 5th Century B.C.E. This word was misunderstood to be coined by Arabs, by medieval and some modern Indian Historians. But this was only an extention of the name used by the Greeks. The Arabic term\\xa0al-Hind, referred to the land of the people who live across the river Indus. By the 13th century, the word\\xa0Hindustanbegan to be used as a popular alternative name for India, meaning the &quot;land of\\xa0Hindus&quot;. Towards the end of the 18th century, the European merchants and colonists referred collectively to the followers of the Dharmic religions in\\xa0Hindustan\\xa0— which geographically referred to most parts of the northern Indian subcontinent — as\\xa0Hindus. Eventually, any person of Indian origin who did not practice Abrahamic religions came to be known as a Hindu, thereby encompassing a wide range of religious beliefs and practices.<br><br>One of the accepted views is that the\\xa0ism\\xa0was added to\\xa0Hindu\\xa0in the early part of the nineteenth century by English writers to denote the culture and religion of the high-caste Brahmans. The word\\xa0Hinduism\\xa0was soon adopted by the Hindus themselves, as a term that encompassed their national, social and cultural identity.<br><br>The original word for the now-so-called Hindus is\\xa0Sanatan\\xa0and\\xa0Arya. The word Hindu is believed to not appear in the Hindu scriptures, viz, Vedas, Upanishads, and Puranas. The contemporary Hindus are believers of and accept the authority of the said scriptures, hence, they are more accurately identified as\\xa0Sanatanis\\xa0or\\xa0Aryans. Another word which is more accurate than Hindu, is\\xa0Bhaaratiya. People of India are believed to be the descendants of King Bharat. From his name comes the original name of India,\\xa0Bhaarat, and, those residing in\\xa0Bhaarat\\xa0are\\xa0Bhaaratiya.<br><br>everything was based on geographical area or by the work.<br><br>This illiterate doesn&#39;t even know the meaning of hindu and talk about hindu.<br>Even the renowned economists of this world Chanakya said Bharat not as hindu.<br><br>Regarding Who wrote Bible? <br>You must be given the Nobel Prize bvz bible is not made of one single thing.

How can anyone be so blind to see. Hinduism is on its declining phase😞 Secularism Died in 1990 Kashmiri Hindu persecution...<br>I am a Proud Mad Mad Mad Hindu.... Mahabharat yes was a matriarchal story... Because  it was fought for the respect of a woman ( Draupadi) , yea we don&#39;t hear a lot about women In  that story because it was a war ... And just like present times there weren&#39;t many Female warriors ... Mahabharat was fought for the rights of a woman and her respect and was fought to kill those rapists and Monsters Bhai karam pe dhyan do dharm pe nhi... Hindu extremist Jago India k Muslims<br>Tum logo ko Bhi kashmir ki trh ab aik azadi ki tehreek suru krna hoge nahi to ye Hindu esy he tum logo pe zulm krty rhen gy This type of man is a raw material of riots , they work as a fuel to spread hate . <br>Gandhi ji law ko manne vale insan the , aap is trh ki bat krke Gandhi vadi ho bhi nhi sakte. With such extremist thoughts and narrow minded behavior he prove that he&#39;s a big chutiya and i feel pity for him, such ppl will bark and die but Islam will rise and shine <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m37s\">6:37</a> .<br>Not at all a unsubstantiated claim. There are many sources which prove India was the best in terms of equality and women were equals. But after the rise of Islam it all went to shit. Never forget what the radicals did in Kashmir few years ago. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m52s\">6:52</a> that&#39;s what he trying to convince himself. <br>I don&#39;t like milk but I like Dodh Pati chai <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m52s\">6:52</a> only Islam teach whole mankind about Respect of Woman about 1400 hundred years ago when woman ware not allowed in Party as guest but as toy like use and through and in Hindustan still no respect for girls compare to Boys. Come in Pakistan and see by yourself how we treat our minorities.

What does that mean Mera bharat mahaan....long live bharat Catholic American here and I’m completely for Hindu nationalism in India! Indians deserve to preserve their way of life and not to have it changed by Muslims or Christians for that matter. We are better off separate from them! Don&#39;t blame Christian they too educate but not evangelism they convert WTAF these type of people  who  spread  anti national  felleing and want the country  to believe  only in one religion  is Fucked up and instead  of changing  the thoughts  of the society they blame  the religion If a peace loving community like the Hindus can be turned to violence then the Muslims and Christians need to introspect on their own behaviour. Islam sikha he k Har aurat or mard ko shiksha do or ye bol raha he islam k bd aurton ko nhi parhao??? Kafiron ko maro jab vo tumhe maren pora quran parho i agree with  him <br> A nation soon will be built with only Hindus.<br>So that we could live with hormony and peace and apply the rules of bhagwadgita properly.<br>The caste system according to bhagwadgita is totally different from the system running today.<br>Moreover its not even called a caste system in bhagwadgita it is stated everywhere as varna system.And it is clearly written to give them place according to their works and deeds.<br>This is real varna <a href=\"http://system.one/\">system.One</a> has to study bhagwadgita to understand what really is tge varna system. Aap kya dikhana ya prove krna chahte hain video  banake? Unfortunately is bande ne jo kaha sb sahi kaha..... Galat kya kaha...

Proved in this video. Without reading the whole scripture, no one should judge any holy book. just reading one smaller section of the book will never make you guyz  understand what the holy book is trying to say, you will be always  in a misconception and have hatred towards Christianity and muslims. Jahil Namakul Insaan Hai Ye... Are chutiye Islam aurat izzath sikata This is a propaganda video to defame Hindus &amp; Hinduism.<br>The subject (person) here is no expert on the historical topics about other religions of the world.<br>Rather, his authenticity about the pain &amp; persecution Hindus have faced throughout history by the very people &amp; followers of religions they allowed to be practiced in their own land is what must be focused on. And in the examples of Hindu persecution he is mentioning, there is absolutely no doubt either.<br><br>The moot point is that the title, &amp; the selection of the subject (person), of this video are motivated to defame Hindus &amp; Hinduism. I am secular Hindu and I don&#39;t give a fuck about Hindu nationalist agendas . we all are humans . Ignorance is the word. He is true Hindu Yeto chalta phirta khatra hain.. India is no doubt a terror Nation. just here for the comments Hahahaha  islam  bolta  hai  jo  tum  per  hamla  karay  us  say  fight  karo  our  musalman  appas  mein  Bhai  hain Dimagh m gobar , munh m tatti Well he is just describing the reality in India and I agree with him to a huge extent , I used to be blindly secular but now I take a much nuanced approach regarding it. Jai HINDU 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 Drawpati ki shadi ka example de rha hai bhai.  Ye bhi bta deta ki konse dharam me pati ke mrne ke bad patni ko sati kar diya jata tha.  Jaise aurat insan na ho use aadmi ka juta ho sath me jala do. Many Hindu bhai ko chote bache Jo DRD hospital mein Yogi Adityanath ki Hospital ki Aditya ki government mein kya hua Woh oxygen Kaise Mare the समझ गया मैं तू गोदसेवादी है। For thousands of years we hindus have been persecuted by muslims and then brits <br><br>We never invaded a foreign country<br><br>They invaded us<br>Raped our mothers and daughters<br>Killed our sons<br><br>It is time we rise up<br><br>We will not strike first because our religion prevents us from killing people of other religion<br><br>But when we get hurt<br>We will make sure that all the members of the community and all their allies and sympathizers find their way to their grave I supported u This guy is dumb af like if u agree This is not a biased comment but there are actually verses in Quran which are to be judged and which create suspicion. A regular critique of Islam knows that very well. Galat Kya bol Raha hai? Maybe his knowledge is not accurate when it comes to Quran or Bible. But doesn&#39;t quran encourage Muslims to prosecute non-muslims? Isn&#39;t that the source of Islamic terrorism? Don&#39;t Christian missionaries spread their religion in India by immoral means (bribing the poor)? <br>Hypocrisy chod do Bhai log. Hindus are the most tolerant race on the planet. But, the pseudo secularists of this country are crossing all limits now. <br>We live in a Hindu majority country where minorities enjoy more than just basic civil rights. There is no uniform civil code in the country. Law has been tilted in such a way over the last 70 years that it completely favours minority religions. Only a Hindu can tolerate it. Try talking about minority rights in Saudi Arabia or pakistan. Don&#39;t test our patience and don&#39;t play with fire. laillah-ha-illAllah .. Muhammad-ur- -rasullullah (saw) bus ye yaad rkhlo ye haqeeqat hai.. aur yehi rahegi Agar hindu intolerence hain is ke liye muslim jimmedar i agree what he said <br>but why he didn&#39;t talk about these things<br>when bramhans till now never let progress any dalit hindu because of their believe in f**king manuscript ideology. Nationalism is a code name for fascism these days. ISLAM BASS LARLI TO BURE NAZAR SE BACHNA SIKHAYA HAI PARDA MAI REHNA SIKHLAYA HAI YEH BAAT GALAT H TMHRI TM LOG PEHLE SE HI LARKI PAIDA HONE P KAT DETE THE OR KUAN MAI NALA MAI FAEK DETE THE LARKI LOG KO ISLAM AAYA TO TMHE SAMJHAYA KI YEH GALAT HAI LARKI KI QAULE BTAAI YEH BAAT GALAT HAI DOST LAKIN AAJ V KAI JAGHA HINDU K GHAR MAI BETI PAIDA HO TO MAR DETE HAI All I see is honest man he didn&#39;t say anything anti minority he said nationalist but titles shows him hindu nationalist What&#39;s the difference between this man and a Nazi in 1940&#39;s Germany? Both were under the illusion that they&#39;re being taken over by the minority and wanted a large scale ethnic cleansing. Such people are the real terrorists to our democracy. I seriously doubt the stats where India is shown as 4th worst country. You are trying to compare a country like India which has a very complex social fabric where you will find all sorts of religions living at the same locality, with some countries where there is roughly 2-3 religions at all. You say that china, pakistan and numerous other states are less dangerous is quiet surprising.<br>However It may be possible because these countries don&#39;t allow minorities to thrive and don&#39;t give them a single chance to raise their voices against the majority. One who does is abducted, tortured or killed!<br><br>I mean the comparison index is as idiotic and unjustified as other sections described in this video. U never answered the question about u being a Brahmin. &#39;Cos in your religion no. 1 is Brahmin &amp; the rest are garbage. In reality the garbage is majority &amp; in the very near future it will cover the Brahmins from head to toe. The collapse of the caste system will happen. There will be no place to hide. U sound like a RSS boot licker. India pehle mahila pradhan tha fir panditon ne purush pradhan bana ne ke liye auraton pe pahadiyan laga na start kiya. kitne paise me mila ye actor. mjhe half de do mai isse accha acting kr dunga First of all I&#39;m Hindu ..so I&#39;ll tell u a real situation of What happened in my area...it&#39;s about 4-5 years ago There was a community who used to catch pigs in our town They were almost 80-90 people with Thier respective families They where doing this job From Many years continuously There children too...we gave them job at our farm about 2-3 of people..no government gave them job no person approached them and No body was willing to give them any job ...They sometimes used to beg too..pathetic completely pathetic and yeah all were Hindus.. in 2015 Christian missionaries approached them gave Them money gave them home gave job in Thier colleges and hospitals..gave Thier children hostels and school which they lacked from like years.. even though there was a continuous Hindu government so They got converted in Christian might be Brain washing might be allurence might be bribing..<br><br>.but whats important A religion or Hunger???<br><br>They are living A good life now completely changed people...<br>Hindu God didn&#39;t worked for them nor Hindu politician or government are they wrong??

Fortunately majority of hindus dont digest all these BS propaganda.. I&#39;m an Indian Atheist. I like this guy, He seems like a Great and Honest guy. Would buy him Tea and sit and talk with him :) I think the same as him - Islam and Christianity are Dangerous Ideologies just like Nazism and Communism - Ideologies that demand Total Submission and consider themselves Superior. <br><br>And how do they consider themselves Superior  ? By claiming Monotheism and that God has chosen only them and insulting people of other beliefs calling them - &quot;Kuffar&quot; or &quot;Heathens&quot;. Muslims and Christians are hated for a reason - They spread Hatred against other Religions in the first place. Christianity promoted Slavery, Colonization, Crusades, Spanish Inquisitions and Witch Hunts. Islam promoted Invasions, Forced Conversions, Slavery, Genocide and Abuse of Women. <br><br>I don&#39;t hate Muslims or Christians, Just like this guy, I hate the Ideology of Islam and Christianity. This is my Freedom of Expression under Democratic India which gives everyone Free Speech to say whatever they wish as long as it doesn&#39;t incite violence against anyone. Islam teaches peace. May Allah guide you to the right path ameen. In that case.. Most mahila padhan place today on earth would be Montreal, Canada 🙄🙄🤔 The path on which they are going will only lead to the destruction of India. Suppose they get rid of all the Muslims and Christians  and all the other minorities  and India only have Hindus then who do you think the people in power and leander who use hate as a means to get votes will target then ? Fact is India need better employment, education and healthcare system. Hate is just a distraction from real issues. Religion is secondary, we are human first. Ask the right questions for your sake and for the sake of your future generations. India is such an amazing country, just imagine what we all can achieve if we all work together. We could become the best country in this world better than USA or Russia. Think for a better tomorrow ye left right left right videos dekh ke dimag ki chatni ho gayi.....

Everyone have their own thoughts Pure sign of unawareness and lack of knowledge and seems he is following what is been taught to him rather than actual facts I agree ! Tum logon ka deemag sad Gaya hai This guy is a lunatic. Lol come on muslims are not dying to live in india they want to settle in developed country like i did I&#39;m living in turkey with my family and enjoying a much better standard of living. And majority want the same so don&#39;t worry no one&#39;s want to take over India mostly wants to move to developed countries 🤞 This peace which is being portrayed today is Hindu 2.0 they don’t believe in their scriptures. New pandits are copying text from other scriptures and sources. And doing cult and satanic activities which they have being doing from centuries. Would like to know where in the Bible is one asked to stone someone to death if one does not believe in Christianity! That’s what you speak after Gobar transplantation surgery.

We won&#39;t persecute anyone, We don&#39;t hate anyone, We don&#39;t have enmity against anyone, We Hindus have forgiven all past crimes of Islamic Invaders and Christian Colonizers. <br><br>We Hindus just want our Bhaarat the way it was Historically, Before Foreign Invaders arrived in India. To hell with Secular India - A Vile and Perverted Western Concept that never fits Indian society !!! When you are using unsubstantiated claim when he was giving reference from history, that&#39;s actually philosophy where people put forth reasons and logics on the basis of prevailing claims. So please don&#39;t undervalue everything what he is saying. I am HINDU but I think blaming everything on ISLAM is not correct.... He say FEMAIL DOMINATE SOCITY.... RAMAYAN m to glti RAVAN ki thi saza MATA SITA ko ku mili.. glti INDRA DEV ki thi pathr AHILYA DEVI ko bnana pda .... Make Islam Great Again in India.

WTF , where is it written in the Bible to stone our non-belivers I’m from Afghanistan we always had a very good relationship with our Hindu and Sikh brothers. Their temple is right next to our mosque and I always thought Hindus were peace loving people but after coming across this video I don’t know what to think any more. My message is that we should never get so passionate in what we believe to the extent to hate another innocent human being just because they believe in a different deity. After all we are all human being, whether we are Christian Hindu or Muslim. This guy is maligning and misinterpreting not only the Sanatana Philosophy but also the Sikh ethics and tenets.

Thank you Mr. JINNAH for Pakistan. Imagin life of minorties in india while people hv mindset like him. I&#39;ve read the entire bible. Nothing of stoning of a non Christian is ever written.  Just because there is no one to prove the truth to them they believe anything I was expecting something foolish and ignorant.<br>He speaks well, and is well informed. As you can read this is the true India all he saying is kill every non Hindu so it can be pure Hindu nation no one is safe Muslims Buddhist  Sikhs like the destroying of the golden temple an massacre of thousands of Sikhs in the aftermath of Indra Gandhi death not a apology to this day bad times in India for minoritys worse to come yet with there kind of thought Christianity and islam are the enemies of hinduism and all other dharmic religions. Im a kafir unsubstantial claim on Draupadi&#39;s 5 marriages?? seriously??? hindu phobics brother if you have counter answer for his reply why don&#39;t you tell him during interview. you also belongs to so called   secular brigade. shame on you for your coward attitude.👎 Some point of this guy is wrong ....but some are. Truth...btw india is good in secularism only... We can change this mindset only with love and respect for each other........ He clearly has no knowledge about any scripture he is just saying what he heard from so called TV news they also wrote unsustained claim bhakto ko kabhi akal nhi aage 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 So, out of a 1.3 billion population, they interviewed one guy and labeled it &quot;Mindset of a Hindu Nationalist&quot;. Btw, this guy didn&#39;t say anything wrong.

It&#39;s not exactly wrong. The real hindu nationalist and those who knows think they know about all hinduism are those people who knows how to safeguard our relegion when in need but at the same knows how to respect other people&#39;s relegion and knows how to respect minority groups ... Lord Krishna said that above humanity is nothing.. so if some say shit about our relegion we should have power to reply to them but should not effect the other innocent people.

Hundreds of measures of rice and dal are cooked here daily to feed the thousands of worshippers.<br><br>At the Jaya-Vijiya gate of this temple various type of sexual orgies of the god Jagannath can be seen sculptured on granite stones. On the outer walls of this temple are life-size sculptures of the 64 types of sexual mating of men and women as described in the Kamasutra of Vatsyayana.<br><br>The dance Bhajan in this temple begins after 10 p.m each day behind closed doors. It is performed by one of the 120 dancing girls in the service of the temple. Each night a new dancing girl will have to come to the temple to dance before god Jaganath. This dance is witnessed only by the lifeless statue of Jagnnath and the Brahmin priest who plays on the musical instrument.<br><br>As the dance heightens to a crescendo, the girl discards her dress and dances stark naked. She then throws herself to the statue of Jagannath in an ecstasy shouting “O Lord, I am thy bride, please make love with me”.<br><br>Whether it is the lifeless idol of Jagannath or the living Brahmin priest who makes love with her is not known (It is strictly forbidden for Non-Hindus to enter the Jagannatha temple).<br><br>Dancing girls who have retired form the service of god Jagannath are now making both ends meet by leading a life of prostitution in the streets of holy Puri.

He is the son born to Siva and Vishnu as a result of a homosexual act.<br><br>To escape from the curse of the powerful demon Durwasa, all the gods joined together and churned the milky ocean to gather “Amrut”-a butter-like ambrosia. They collected the “Amrut” in a pot, and kept it to be served at a heavenly feast. An Asura (demon) from the nether world stole the pot of ” Amrut from Develoka. When the loss of the ambrosia was detected, the omniscient Vishnu was able to know where it was. He went to the nether world in the guise of Mohini, a woman of exquisite beauty, and brought and back the “Amrut” and served it to the gods. When Mohini was serving the Amrut, Shiva got intoxicated with her beauty and had sexual intercourse with her, who was in reality Vishnu. Vishnu became pregnant as a result of the homosexual act, and gave birth to Sastha from his thigh.

Matlab kuch bhi uthake bol do ge, are poora chapter to padho ke baat Kya ho rahi hai Quran mein.<br>Moreover ISLAM is the first religion who gave rights to the women.<br>1.

Islam said women is more close to the angels than a man.<br>3.Islam said your mother is 3times better than your father.<br><a href=\"http://4.in/\">4.In</a> Islam women is like a diamond, that&#39;s why it&#39;s allowed to cover her body and protect herself from evil eyes of world.<br>5. In Islam a woman is given a part from will of his parents. And this a woman right 1400ago old given by Islam. Unlike America which gave this right in 1900s to the woman.<br>6. In Islam girl child is more supiriour, As said by prophet Muhammad (PBUH) If a man has 3or4 girl child, he educated them, raised them well and married them to good house, then he will get paradise. <br>100s of rights given by Islam.

Debate karnese q darte ho...jao debate karo Muslim o se Long Live HINDUISM, Long Live India and the hindu nations, fight for your rights &amp; religion! the Hindu brother said it well and truthfully. JAIHIND When truth is spoken openly..... Then u get 6.5k dislikes 😂😂😂...... The world is so much brainwashed now a days..... People just refuse to accept common sense. Jahiliyt on its peak . This guy seems to know the awful things written in the scriptures of other religions, but is living in convenient forgetfulness about the equally awful things written in the Hindu scriptures. How convenient! Typical RSS mentality. I am not surprised because if you have been to these Saraswati Shishu Mandirs, Ekal Vidyalyalas or RSS run shakhas right from a young age, the kind of indoctrination and conditioning will rip you off whatever little logical reasoning skills you anyways had. The kind of animosity that that you then nurture for people of other faiths is a direct result of this indoctrination. It will take years of reading and critical thinking to come out of it. After this I will be watching Mosque and Madarassas Dispatches and Zakir Naiks video to become a liberal Secular Indian 🤣😂🤣.<br><br>Every word he utters is factually spot on Truth. Only propagandist, Theocratic Fascists like the wire, The scroll, The diplomat and Siasat daily should come up with stupid narratives and edited propaganda against Our People. Indian people. Hahaha.. stating facts versus hate is different idiots. Most Hindus have experienced the fact about Proselytising Abrahamic cults like Christianity and especially Islam<br><br>I think the guy is Crystal clear. He doesn&#39;t have Muslim. Muslims are Islamists, conservative, Orthodox, moderate, liberal, ex-muslims.. he definitely knows it and makes distinction between Islam the ideology and people. But the problem are Islamists ( Jihadis ) Orthodox, Conservative and the modest who stay silent using Kitman and Twariya.<br><br>Only a few liberal Muslims and ex-muslims are okay but Islam is a death cult.<br><br>If talking facts about religions and religious scriptural facts is a Hindu nationalism then I am a proud Hindu nationalist.<br><br>But the guy who lies about other religions and incites jihad and radical evangelical Islam Zakir Naik is the peaceful messenger 🤣😂🤣 Get the Fuck out of here <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=7m25s\">7:25</a> Aur Tu Chai Walla Hi Rahega...What Kind Of Uneducated People We Donate Them Leadership Chai walla becomes PM...That Yogi Animal(***) Briyani Lover Becomes  CM We Are Coming Bro...Soon You Got To Many Problems With Islam.

Hindus should always stand for tolerance, humanity, equality, brotherhood, etc but first they should first stand for themselves. Whenever a discussion on world religious intolerance is presented Hinduism is made the bad guy coz there will be no one to say anything.  Path of peace is path to happiness and is universal but not expressing any objections to unnecessary blames is pure sign of coward.<br><br><br>Hindu nationalist is rising and is a problem in few states in India but there are other states were religion intolerance is shown by different religion and yet those issues are totally ignored.<br><br><br>We are all Indian and we are all equal but would it be actually true if such discrimination is made while addressing religious intolerance. Chutiya.. Fuck u Thank God .....I am a proud Hindu Nationalist This men is mentally sick he is from rss i don’t no they want to divid India based on religion cast area language you people don’t understand anything from any religious books you understand religion by bad people you people like Pakistan good taliban bad taliban both are wrong rss taliban bokoharam isis Bajrang dal vhp this type of ideology is dangerous for humanity you people are in India then their ll be no development only communal rights Allah give them hedaith.

Wow so much hate लभ जू रहेगा भाई Hinduism says to take weapons? Then why are you people blaming other religious texts??? you can suck on your political correctness we are better hyper nationalists than helping these people Read the quran fully.

This mentality is all about blaming others and claiming innocence. That’s exactly why we will remain backwards. Hinduism is only good for the upper classes, for thousands of years we lower classes suffered, fuck it, i’m athiest. Fuck Hinduism too. Sahi bol raha h ye aadmi Islam ne puri duniya me bhasad macha ke rakha h. Gore Vidal would support the first line Bilkul such kha bhai This man is actually a genius... Constantine didn&#39;t write the Bible. 40 different authors did. That stupid quoted from the old testament, which is Judaism, not the N.T, which the Christians follow. And at that time, people from the other religions Eg: the ancient Canaanite religion used to sacrifice their own children to their &#39;gods&#39; which is why Judaism has such strict laws. True That&#39;s True If Hinduism is true religion why its only in India I mean pure world me kahi or kyun nahi hai like christian population Muslim population its mean in this whole world Hindu is right and everyone go hell damn lol To all Hindu nationalists: If India is going to be a Hindu nation when will you leave Kashmir?

And bro aapne khud kaha jab apkai pass koi option nhi rehta to hathiyar to uthane pdenge.... Same chiz prophet  Muhammad  s a w pbuh nai ki thi..

There is no attempt to put the points and allowing the man to counter. All points by The Diplomat have been made in a judgemental manner and an assertive matter of fact way. Horrible journalism. ALLAH jise hidayat deta Hain usse he musalman Bana ta hai Islam is the best religion and the religion with more reverts and the fastest growing religion you guys are just  jealous that Islam is getting stronger day by day Raja Ramchandra ki jai Proud to be hindu What he is telling is less than the Dalit facing today.

I Am Hindu , I am Simple Man <br>I Hate All religion Equally this indian dude is deeply brain washed. acts like he knows about geopolitics but diesnt know shit of whats going on in the world hindu uprising and fundamentalism is pretty much like islamic fundamentalism, but its just that islamic fundamentalism doesnt have popular support but hindu fundamentalism does have popular support, in pakistan we dont elect mullahs, but in india they do elect hindu mullahs in a state like UP which is as big as Pakistan itself.<br><br>regards Yes yes we all know who&#39;s killing who in India right now. You take one extremist right wing person with little to no knowledge of real Islam And Christianity and hear him defend the reason his people are killing and lynching Muslims and Christians and other minorities. All while saying Hinduism promotes equality and peace. HAHA. Joke of the millenia. pure honest noncriminal hindu believer Im a dalit hindu sab se pehle varna vawastha ka ant karo.  Phir bharat ki baat kar.    Saare daliton ko 1000’s of years se apna gulam banake rakha hai.   Jai beeem.

It&#39;s a religion of peace and the bible speaks of stonning people as a custom done by the hebrews. The land of India actually belonged to dravidians and this Aryan race the so called Hindus came to this land from Eurasia killing many on their way  for pasture lands. The guy knows less about our faith that&#39;s why he is saying that and also the Hindus in Kerala eat beef, what does he have to say about this? Minorities ko unka hisa dy k unhain India sy alag ker do! Iska  chara  badalne  ki jaroorat  h  bhai  kheto  me jaya  kro gaash  khane.

Pseudo liberals in India must watch this video Said by JESUS CHRIST in the BEATITUDES in Mathew  5 3-10, Blessed are The Peacemakers for Theirs is the Kingdom Of Heaven. You can&#39;t do the mind of Muslim nationalist <br>because you also know that they can&#39;t be nationalist Abey chuthiye draupadi ki baath kartha Hain....toh bol kyo duryodhan ne draupadi ki vasthrabaharan Kiya tha....tab waha koi Muslim tha ya koi Islam waley waha pey the...jo sab majey le rahe the.... When a Christian or a Muslim kills, he is a terrorist. When a Hindu kills, he is a nationalist! What an irony man?<br>P.S: I am a hardcore humanist who was born in a staunch Hindu family. half knowledge is dangerous for everyone.  if u don&#39;t know about islam plz learn. what is Islam. Fuck Islam!!!<br>The world would be a better place without Islam.<br>Jai Shri Ram<br>Jai Hind 💪 jab calcutta killings huwi thi aur hindu aurtoon ka balatkar ho rha tha tab yeh Regious Violence Index kaha tha?

I have read it. You go check it yourself. Hindustan jindabad I&#39;m a Mad Mad Hindu.. The mind of a christian nationalist...show poverty in developing countries, send christian missiinaries, send ngos to help them convert and then control their economies in a way that the people remain poor Hinduism means untouchability. The graph that shows religious violence status is misleading as it is not by population but by total and India is 4x the size of USA so if you want stats use it correctly by showing stats by population demographics Fuck U you guys dont have guts to make a video on &quot;a mind of muslim nationalist&quot; I literally dont know what problem you guys have with hinduism just leave us alone they attack hindus first and when we fireback then we are extremist. BJP jindabad Naretakbir &#39;Allah Hu Akbar Jay hind Ek bhi fact sahi nahin hai A common man slapped at the face of communist&#39;s mindset. Brilliant Wow awesome yaar ..aise hi Lage raho bhai .

And those aren&#39;t unsubstantiated claims, they have been proven over and over in history. Love and support from this brahmin. हर हर महादेव। जी श्री राम।। Muslims are lik younger bothers to hindus in India... they don’t have much power still have parent’s (government) support. Everything shown in video is truth except the subtitle given by the dimplomat :p like mahabharata and all....read wikipedia or go to <a href=\"http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/\">hinduism.stackexchange.com</a>. <br><br>Now a days journalist more like leftist or liberal, even I also want to be like that. But not from only one side. You want to remove modi, that&#39;s fine, but first give better opposition(just talk about minority), and not Italian mafia who don&#39;t have any feeling for farmer or even minority, anybody can get it after scam like DFL. It is strange in India that anyone other than Hindus can proudly identifies himsellf with his religion and is considered secular But for hindus to be recognised as secular he should throw his customs into the dustbin and  never  exposes himself to be a hindu at any cost  People of other religions sporting theiir  appearance and manners true to their custom are revered and appreciated But Hindus are treated  with disdain and contempt if he displays  marks of Hindu identity in public by secular forces  initiated  by congress  and other psudosecular forces omg! what think Hindu! 😲😲 Are not hindu fighting muslim now? Wah bhai bilkul shi jai hindutva Honest man This guy awake me... Thanms diplomate and this guy.... All Hindu unite... Silly <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Presstitute\">#Presstitute</a> Don&#39;t read the comments it&#39;s a waste of time and full of hatred Dual face ppl, who’s mentality is that much fundamental hated about others then y thy say about democracy, democracy my foot in India, these fundamental ppl r out of control in India, wel we can see their PM butcher of gujarat Constantine didn&#39;t write the Bible and the Bible wasn&#39;t written 300 years after Christ. For every action there will be an equal reaction.If you Discriminate against any religion in a modern state,there will be civil war and your country will be divided again.Just like in 1947....<br>But extremists are unable to understand this. Jai shree ram No community should firstly regard itself as more superior to another. We are all human beings at the end of the day. Let us have more tolerance and respect in the world. This kind of hate only invites further violence and destruction in society. It upsets me that people can’t see that. Certainly neither Christianity nor Islam promote hate. I’m afraid things are being twisted and taken out of context, or the actions of a few people are being used to tarnish a whole community, which is completely unjustified and unfair Hindus have long forgotten their true practices. With this man and all others like him it is evident there&#39;s no light on his face or in his heart. His head is a tombstone of his body which is a graveyard and his soul is buried underneath. Shame on him and all you that support him. But truth must walk through the burning test and so it&#39;s evident islam is walking through it. Good brother i love you nationalist is blood proud of you....love..from lahore..pakistan Bakwas yah ahdemee pagal hogayah hai Hindu  gareebu ko hamase say dalit ko dabatay hai i dont know whether you are a Perfect Hindu nationalist or not but if you are then i must say you people are misguided....You people need to learn what does islam say ..?

Women owned properties and husband was mere servant. Even today, only daughter can inherit the lands belonging to maternal ancestry while father&#39;s lands will have to be divided among Son and daughter. So why we need police and army anymore in our country, it seems like we are wasting lots of money as salary for this officers . The compleate system of defence can handle by BJP just provide them arms and also provide cyanide for rest of non-BJP followers . Clearly he probably went thru rough time with Muslim but who gave him rights to blame Islam not even .1 % he knows about Islam <br>Along with all this people who comment here <br>So stupid !!

For you is your religion, and for me is my religion<br><br>I RESPECT TRUE HINDUS  , <br>because thay are broad minded I can&#39;t lie,yes I&#39;m a hindu nationalist. I know it was sarcastic against this type of mentality but u have to mention that because people are dumb enough to believe these stuff Ask your hindu brothers to leave the western countries where they are enjoying all the benefits. You really care about your hindu brothers.  I have seen for myself how the Brahmins treat the lower caste Hindus. If it were possible I would stop all Christians from carrying out any relief work like food and clothing.  Let their rich hindu brothers help them. Hindus should respect the fact that there are different religions in the country like Saudi being an islamic country still hasn&#39;t banned the consumption of pork Christian&#39;s and Muslims make up about 50% of the countries population so should just accept it and live with it like others live with the fact of a visarjan and polluting the rivers lakes and seas of our country and divali being like a major cause of resporatory issues <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UiTSydIqNdA\">https://youtu.be/UiTSydIqNdA</a> get ur facts straight spread peace may allah bless u hav a good day brother If he was in pakistan i will slap him his cheeks.

Religion be it any has it&#39;s own negativity whether god exists or not is debatable but killing people in the name of that be it any religion is not chivalrous .. People who gets killed in the riots especially during Hindu vs Muslim riots have nothing to do with those riots and why they die cause most of them are innocent and the people who are guilty gets away easily .. BJP is using this Hindutwa ideology to gain votes but look how beneficiary it was during 2014s and now look at it the person I believe was from Madhya Pradesh there BJP lost and many other states it&#39;s not because people hates Modi and started loving Rahul it is because people want development , the sole idea with which Modi came to power not Hindutwa ! We all have to understand religion is a personal choice and we all to respect it but if you vote a party for it&#39;s religious biased attitude is idiotic ! I will give you how idiotic these claims , Bjp keeps on taking oath of saving cows and then again in Kerela &amp; North East they say vote us we will give you the best beef you ever had ! My family is Hindu but we stay in a locality where majority is hindu then Muslims and after that few Christian families but we didn&#39;t kill each other just cause we have different faiths.. Hindus talk about Swami Vivekananda as their idol right ? Then Belur Math which preaches his words has a place for namaz and few days back held a puja for Jesus Christ on 25 the dec ( though being an atheist I find it hypocritical) so that harmony resides in all of us .. Religion is the last thing we should care about , humanity should reside in all of us .. Please dont listen to any brain washed children like these be it Hindu , Muslim or any religion ! Live and Let Live ! He has all wrong facts and a pure idiot Because of u like people Hinduism also destroy u sick minded ugly nonsense .<br>Urs words only shows urs entire educational system is worlds worst education.<br>Get ready urs self and urs upcoming generations for this poor mentality .

And now just waiting for their Hindu rashtra. Hat&#39;s off to them. agree bhai Poore dharm ki jay pr islam ki ni Ab toh bakt aa gya h mullo ki maa chodo Why did Trump win in the US? Because of his anti-muslim image. LOL BOI , STOP SMOKING TOO MUCH XD. Jhootha aadmi<br>Mindless .senseless He is a true human Never underestimate the power of idiots in a huge crowd. Manu smriti and later chapters of Rig Veda were not written by Mughals. This idiot will find support from other idiots. Brain wash kia hai sangio ne iska Indeed nationalism is toxic EPIC TALES  USED BY THE BRAHAMANS  TO CREATE A RELIGION.<br>They(brahmins) have created &amp; appointed different gods of their origin and choice . So, I name departmental gods as each God bears of a particular department &amp; receive particular offering. Brahma , the creator of the universe , a nominal god but treated as the originator. Secondly, Vishnu takes care of all people . Shiva , destroyer of evils. Likewise, there are many other gods to be named their departments.\\r<br>\\r<br>Ganesh &amp; Saraswati , gods of education. Biswakarma , god of architecture &amp; Kali, goddess of energy etc. Laxmi, goddess of wealth &amp; treasury.Let’s ponder over the serious matter for a moment to find out its reality. Let’s raise a question in our minds to get the concrete &amp; valid answer. As it is believed as per the Hindu mythology that there are 33 crore gods .We the people are trapped, captivated, enslaved by the magical mythologies of brahmins. Before the arrival of Muslims in India,  there was no concept of  MODESTY,  CHASTITY AND FIDELITY  in the natives.  One of the examples is Chennar Revolt, the struggle of the women for the right to COVER THEIR BREASTS.<br>The Channar revolt exposed the caste fault-line that ran deep in the kingdom of Travancore. The Nadars embraced Christianity promoted by British missionaries as a way out of the oppressive caste order enforced by upper caste Hindus, which included the royalty. While caste Hindus didn’t object to the conversion, they resisted the attempt of lower castes to claim social parity with them by moving out of Hinduism. At the core of the Channar revolt was caste Hindus’ resistance to the idea of equality. Dress had become a metaphor for equal rights — a subversive idea that rejected the graded inequality embedded in the social hierarchy founded on caste Chutiya log Bhai islamic country dekho uhapar bhi india se bahat kum rape hota hai bhai. Agar muslim ya islam se yeah ate hai to us country me kyun jiyada nahi bhai .

He really has spread the wrong thing of Christianity there is nothing written in the Bible about pelting stones on brother if he doesn&#39;t follows Christianity<br>Just check in the internet or in the Bible  it&#39;s nothing like that so please don&#39;t divide BJP govt is going to go in 2019.

I am Muslim but I’m also obsessed with Hinduism It&#39;s very easy and convenient for Hindus to support hinduism. In India we are Hindu or Muslim by birth not by choice. This man will instill his prejudices to his children as his parents did with him and the  chain will continue. Every religion&#39;s core message is to love. But thanks to crooked humans, we instill so many evils and violence in it. The saddest part is, many religious leaders would say their religion is in danger but he/she won&#39;t be attacked.  They would politicise one death and instill fear and vengeance in hearts  of people and inspire to kill others. Similar reaction occurs in every religion.  Some see this as a business opportunity and some as a vote bank. It is human beings, the followers, the powerless who are in danger. And unfortunately they are the ones who would be a threat to many in a moment of frenzy. It is surprising that a man so learned is making such fallacious claims. Every religious texts would have instructions of violence in it. But the religion as such does not stand for violence.

Pasu dhol sudra naari sab tadan ke adhikari..iska meaning padh le chutia samaj me ajyega ki original hindu dharm kya hai ..jai moolniwasi jai bheem Sorry friends, this man has completely misunderstood Indian history or has not read it at all. He hatred for Muslims has made him biased to the core. <br>Aryans came to India abt 3500 years ago. They established thier suprermacy by defeating the indigenous people who worshipped nature and treated women with respect ( ramnants if Indus valley civilization is a historical evidence). <br>The aryans established thier own social, religious and cultural systems. It was Varna and then caste based system, which was sanctified as God given. It is wrong to say that inequality of women came from Islam. The caste system treats animals, women and sdudras as inferior creatures. Pl remember the first Islamic raider entered Indian subcontinent in the 10 th century AD, hundreds of years before Islam came to India. So you can see clearly that he has found an alibi to hide the weakness of his own culture by blaming a culture he hates. <br>I think that y and large all Hindus hate Islam and Christianity because their followers ruled our country. I will make 2 points in this regard: one, we lost battles to armies which were very very small mainly due to our caste system which prevents unity amongst us. We should introspect whether it is Islam, Christianity or our own social system which is responsible for the defeats. Two, unlike the unlimited powers of monarchs in the past, we are living in a democratic country where no single power enjoys unlimited power. And our constitution prevents rule/hegemony of any individual culture.under the circumstances the sensible approach to adopt is to forget the perceived humiliation of the past and get on to the path of nation building. Our nation will never progress if we carry the baggage of hatred towards our own country men. <br>Thanks I have lost my speech...<br>I am ashamed of being a human..<br><br>because,<br>being a human I can&#39;t show mercy to my own people..<br><br>I don&#39;t  know when this world will be changed..<br>we all will die one day..<br>those who are killed in Gujarat riot..<br>they are gone...<br>and those who killed them will die..<br>no one will escape from judgement.. Am a hindu &amp; love Islam &amp; Christianity ♥️ Utter nonsense about christianity. Bible never says anything like this. Show me a verse from bible which says this about christianity. He&#39;s exact speaking the truth . What happened ur teeth bro, all ur religion keep it home, when u come out from ur house plz talk abt humanity, jobs, development plz thanx bro abe PAGAL Nationalist ab tu keh raha hai ladkiyon ko padhana naapadhana aur andhere mein hi rakhna yeh sab Islam se sikha kahana tune chal kabhi Kerala gaya hai tu? wahaan toh Brahmins logon ne nincha jaati ke auraton ko kamar se neeche sirf ek kapda pehenneka matlab half nude rehneka aadesh diya tha Jab Saint  &quot;Sri Narayan Guruji&quot; ne halath sudhaari shoshit logon ko justice dilwaya aur agar ninche jaat paat ke log VEDH MANTRA ko agar kahin sun lete toh LEAd ko pighlaake uske ear pe daaldete the.. SATISAHAGAMAN aur BALYA VIVAAH in sab cheezon ko Islam se sikha??  India mein Islaam aanese pehle hi yeh sab chal raha tha.. Islam ko blame karne se pehle  ISLAM  ko  jaanle ये जहर भारत के लिये खतरनाक है, Violence and Hatred was existed before Christianity and Islam in India. Well religion will always make people blind. Let it be Islam itself. While I being a Muslim itself I say it. A person who is going to slaughter a cow (even if it is illegal in some states of India) for business purpose, should he be killed. Btw, aap k piyar USA main aap ki mother cow ko kaat diya jaata hai to kiya un ko bhe ja k maaro gyyy. Ya USA wali cows aap ki mother nhn hain kiya? Asal baat ye hai keh aap tasveer ka aik rukh daikhty ho. Jo hindu maary gaye un ka to dard hai magar musalman bhe to maary gaye naa. Asal behs yahan aa k rukti hai keh kis ny start kiya aor kis ny ziada maary. jo keh irrelevant baat hai. warna dukh ki baat ye hai keh donon trf sy innocent log maary gaye. aor sb k sath hamdardi honi chaheye. Hamain bhe India sy migrated log bataty hain keh hamary saamny ye shartain thein keh yaaa to hindu ban jaao ya phir yahan sy nikal jao. Unfortunately he is quoting tuba without context. Why Mahabharata was fought way before than Islam and Christianity. He should try to read his own Hindus and Sikhs leaders about the greatness of Islam.

So if you repent, that is best for you; but if you turn away - then know that you will not cause failure to Allah . And give tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment.<br>Excepted are those with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in anything or supported anyone against you; so complete for them their treaty until their term [has ended]. Indeed, Allah loves the righteous [who fear Him].<br>And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.<br>And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah . Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.<br>How can there be for the polytheists a treaty in the sight of Allah and with His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at al-Masjid al-Haram? So as long as they are upright toward you, be upright toward them. Indeed, Allah loves the righteous [who fear Him].<br>How [can there be a treaty] while, if they gain dominance over you, they do not observe concerning you any pact of kinship or covenant of protection? They satisfy you with their mouths, but their hearts refuse [compliance], and most of them are defiantly disobedient.<br>They have exchanged the signs of Allah for a small price and averted [people] from His way. Indeed, it was evil that they were doing.<br>They do not observe toward a believer any pact of kinship or covenant of protection. And it is they who are the transgressors.<br>Quran Chapter 60 verse 8 and 9\\xa0\\xa0<br>Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.<br>Allah only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion - [forbids] that you make allies of them.

Good more videos should come up Hindu is the best peace religious. <br>Some hindu jai chand anti national media insulting India like diplomat. sick people sick mentality You don&#39;t know anything, being taught by RSS school. It&#39;s what you can expect from media these days,one man&#39;s personal beliefs and ideals portrayed as representation for whole community. Can diplomat tell us what  made him the ideal candidate for this representation? Is it because it suits your narrative of what hindus are? 80-90 crore +  hindus and you generalize it with one example. This is just why media is losing its credibility both in West and India alike. Basically the guy is a supporter of anarchy. Also the guy has zero knowledge of history (Satipratha). In every relegion there are good people and bad people&#39;s all human beings are one. Don&#39;t spread hatred spread peace. Read Babasaheb Ambedkar to understand   and defeat RSS for a peaceful India You should also make a video on Muslim extremists and large number of conversions of innocent people by giving them money or some false promises. the rape thing he mentioned was accurate You tried very hard diplomat to show hindus in a bad light but fuck you he is way better than you pseudo seculars.

Actually the diplomat tried to defame him to propagate the agenda that hindu nationalist &#39;s mind is filled with hate by negating his facts by producing some flimsy facts about islam and christianity but it all backfired because he was well read and aware and it resonated with the whole lot of people on YouTube, and his message is spreading. Sometimes in trying to do more harm, media driven prestitutes make good mistakes. More people would now know the reality why hindu nationalist org&#39;s like RSS and shivsena is following this movement, they are not against muslims and christians but the ideology which drives them to hate the other religion and motivates them to kill. Proud to be hindu.. Every religion is equal. Good few corrections here to kill with stone is not if your brother doesn&#39;t follow Christianity if he commits adultery or anything against gods word if he didn&#39;t repent from his heart 2nd Constantine didn&#39;t write the bible its god through prophets wrote this Constantine translated for Constantinople. Christianity says if your brother doesn&#39;t follow pray for the change of his heart because punishment can&#39;t make a man love god. thank you hope i didn&#39;t offended any one India ke jis state me  hindu minority ho rha hai vha vha algavvad badh rha hai ....true Sincerely person Yar Tu phela Bible padd k aa ja phr bolan Bible me ye lika hai ya vo....Esa log hi aage chal k Hindutv ko jhuta bolta hai bcz inko khud ke religion ka gyan nai aur dusro ko judge krna chale......ye khud muslim hai shyad joo partition k time Hindu bnn fya Mental guy don&#39;t know anything speaking about Islam and Christianity A frog in the pond.

I m proud to be an indian muslim . ye kaha se ulti seedhi knowledge lekr aya h... bina bat kuch b bk rha h jahil admi Ok let&#39;s expose this man <br>First thing first Qur&#39;an Ch 9<br><br>1)A declaration of immunity from God and His Messenger to the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty.<br><br>2.\\xa0So travel the land for four months, and know that you cannot escape God, and that God will disgrace the disbelievers.<br><br>3.\\xa0And a proclamation from God and His Messenger to the people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage, that God has disowned the polytheists, and so did His Messenger. If you repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, know that you cannot escape God. And announce to those who disbelieve a painful punishment.<br><br>4.\\xa0Except for those among the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty, and did not violate any of its terms, nor aided anyone against you. So fulfill the treaty with them to the end of its term. God loves the righteous.<br><br>5.\\xa0When the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists wherever you find them. And capture them, and besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every ambush. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and pay the alms, then let them go their way. God is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.<br><br>6.\\xa0And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for protection, give him protection so that he may hear the Word of God; then escort him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.<br><br>7.\\xa0How can there be a treaty with the polytheists on the part of God and His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque? As long as they are upright with you, be upright with them. God loves the pious.<br><br>8.\\xa0How? Whenever they overcome you, they respect neither kinship nor treaty with you. They satisfy you with lip service, but their hearts refuse, and most of them are immoral.<br><br>9.\\xa0They traded away God&#39;s revelations for a cheap price, so they barred others from His path. How evil is what they did.<br><br>10.\\xa0Towards a believer they respect neither kinship nor treaty. These are the transgressors.<br><br>11.\\xa0But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and give the obligatory charity, then they are your brethren in faith. We detail the revelations for a people who know.<br><br>12.\\xa0But if they violate their oaths after their pledge, and attack your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief—they have no faith—so that they may desist.<br>There was a treaty between polytheists , Muslims , Jews that they will coexist . But they(Jews and pagans) broke the treaty and attacked the prophet not to mention that they several times tried to assassinate prophet ( imagine there is treaty between Bangladesh , India , Pakistan   Pakistan and Bangladesh attacked India . And after the attack India regained stability will India not attack Pakistan and drive away them. Verse no 6 it&#39;s written if a man seeks protection Muslims will give them . If a Pakistani general seeks protection will India give them after the attack NO but God ordered Muslims to give protection . This man had not read the Qur&#39;an but articles by Muslim haters. )<br>As for Christianity I don&#39;t know which verse he is quoting <br>But mat 5 : 44 says<br>But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,<br>This man is bull shit .😞 This guy should be put to jail, I totally agree with this man Who is listenig him so carefully .<br>He is lliterate persone about religions. <br>We have a lot of scholars in india .we should listen them , we should read then then we will get some authentic information on the basis of them reserches.

Hindus are the best Meray Lul ko tight kero 🤣🤣🤣 Bullshit! Vote for bjp Same bhai....mera bhi same problem hai Whatever he said about ancient India was true but channel accused him as unsubstantiated claim. If u read our history then u&#39;ll know. Try to dig history and then accuse. Jai hindu Jai shri ram women abuse and rape in India because of Islam? what a fucking joke Haram khoor history check ker apni islam any sy pehly ap sub log kamasurta me marof thy onhi kamasutra ki padysh ho. Jis k dil me just nafrat hi janam ly sakti hy. Na khud sakoon sy jeena hy or na hi kisi ko jeeny dyna hy Haha this guy is funny Happy to see. Indian Muslim ki aqal thikany aa jay gi hindu kabi Muslim ka bhai ni Sach kadvi hota he..  The channel is biased and treating the man guilty... His mind is blocked from childhood which is in front of all. Islam never teaches hatred. How do you find such psychopaths. And mind of a Hindu nationalist? Wf. No one thinks that.  Misleading and abusive. Your channel sucks and i hope it gets reported and shuts down. Why are people so touchy about religion? This is very unhealthy for society, especially for a diverse nation like India. Lets come to Kerala will give delicious beef specially from cow🐄 or calf No religion will be live longer which belives on money and force abhi naahito kaabibhi girjayega. God and Nature will support only peace wait n see how nature will treat you. man is really sick <br> two mindwash centres for India   Kashmir  for muslims  and  Nagpur RSS centres for Hindus he must been to RSS centre He face looks suspiciously like Owaisi(younger brother) 😂😂😂😂 I don&#39;t like how these Hindu nationalists are willing to take law into their hands. But as long as Mullahs, Madrassas and the jihadis they create continue to exist, these Hinduwadis are required. The day Uniform Civil Code is implemented, Madrassas are shut down and politicians stop pandering to Muslims, I wil denounce Hindu nationalists outright. agar koi musalman aisa hi kahe to usse koun sa label laga do ge &quot;terrorist&quot;ha ha behan chodo tum haramzado ki wajeh se poora india barbaad ho jaye ga Dimaag khoul raha he chutiye k vajese Lol this is india... and then they ask muslims why you fear in india and want to leave india Savarkar ji wow Liberals dead and quran ko quote kar raha he toh context me bol... bahu dev wadi lavde pahili baar sun rahe he I&#39;m an Atheist. I wish I headed to a school run by RSS, What a Great opportunity it would have been to learn about my Great Nation and Culture. Instead, I was educated at a Gandhian school learning Fake History and Western Concepts and become one of the Pseudo Liberals, My entire family always voted for Congress Party because &quot;God forbid, BJP Wins and makes India another Pakistan&quot;, According to their stupid beliefs. <br><br>I even dressed as Nehru in my Schooldays without knowing who Nehru was and won the Fancy dress Competition. This is the level of Brainwashing by my Parents who proudly called themselves &quot;Secular&quot; imposed on me as a child. I guess they brainwashed me into too much Secularism to the point that it got disgusting and suffocating.<br><br>I will forever stand for a Hindu India, Let us continue the Dream of our Hindu Ancestors started 500 years ago, Re-Claiming Proud and Great Indian Culture and Civilization from Foreign Ideologies, This is our Homeland, We have no need to apologize to anyone for our Culture, Beliefs, Food Habits, Practices or Traditions !!! Bhai Muslims apne money se bnate hai masjid ok....kbi nhi dusre logo ke money se bnate hai wo government ho ya or koi... Hindus worship Satan This is the reason i want to get the hell out of this country,.   Fck this country ,fck india It is projected in the next 35 years the Muslim population would exceed the Hindu population in india.thoughts? es jahil ko itna pta ni ky trump bi christian hai😂 kutta h ye The oxygen for indian democracy is hindu nationalism . It is best ideology. Ladkiyo ko education na dena...<br>I request all hindu girls who watching this video that they should must read history..<br><br>Who gave them such rights for education. . 😂😂😂 aree bhai darte raho humse...<br>Qasam se tumko phir hamari talwar yaad aati hai..<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MUSLIM\">#MUSLIM</a> NATIONALIST. . <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m37s\">6:37</a> he Surely lived at that time and compare today with the time befor <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=1m54s\">1:54</a> dont Take a simpel verse you have to read it from start to finish otherwise you Got it all wrong I&#39;m glad to see The Diplomat label this man&#39;s claims as &quot;unsubstantiated&quot;. What a religious nut head. Ex muslim here.<br>He is right but people don’t want to admit it. What a joker he is .. Secularism <br>R.I.P 1947 - 2016<br>Cause of Death - Murdered by Facist Ultranationalist BJP Badve tera kitna Hindu gulf mein Aur Christian countries mein kam karte hai Lovde vo bi bolo .. Lovde kidar lika hai Bhai ko marane ko bible mein badve.. Secularism and liberalism is antimajorotarian. Two fundamental reasons why his attitude is unacceptable<br>1. He is anti constitutional. The constitution on which this country is built and runs upon stresses on humanism and equality of all. As an Indian citizen one is bound to live by it or else need to leave the country or work towards the rightful amendment of it.<br><br>2. The attitude of need to take up arms to protect our faith as it is the only way now is completely against the basic principles of Hinduism. The idea of openness, liberty and inclusion of all is what makes Hinduism unique and sets apart from any other so called religious beliefs. If you look at the great Hindu saints you can see that they were all truly liberal ( Ramana maharishi, Budha etc.). True that liberalism and the  welcoming nature of this land has lead to invaders ruling and looting the country but, taking up violence and resorting to &#39;tooth for a tooth&#39; approach to so called preserving a tradition is ironic to the core.<br><br>PS : Don&#39;t get fooled by my screen name Paid Interview Yeh Jo dharam ke thekedar bane phirte hai ye society ke liye danger hai change wo hindu community se ho or Muslim community se Wow Some Hindus are so ethnocentric it’s insane. Just respect all religions and mind your own business brothers Wah re kafir ki aulado apni bahen ma ki izatt kerna tu aata nhi aur dosro ko volta hai Khud ka majhab ka knowledge hai nahi dusre k baare mein bolne chala hai, khud apne hi baat ko badal raha hai, kabhi bol raha hai maarna nahi chahiye aur fir bol raha hai maarna chahiye jab jarurat ho. Yeh supporter hai sirf aur kuch nahi. Christianity and Islam are the biggest enemies of humankind Bhai Quran mei toh yeh likha hai....ki insaan ko hurt krna bahut bada gunah hai....quran ki pehli aayat hi ....Iqra utri ...girls education k liye equality .....kathua mei rape Mandir mei kisne kiya....vo b 6 saal ki bachi ka ,ram Rahim Muslim hai kya,asharam kon hai.....nafrat nhi filani Chahiye.....<br>Har religion peace hi sikhata hai...but problem yeh hai humne religion ko politics ka Sahara bna liya hai.....vote bank k liye Isko Muslim say nhi Islam say dikkat Hai.christan say dusmani nhi Christianity say dushmani hai. thanks. Insaan say nhi sirf religion  say dikkat hai. Waise insaan acche hotel hai dhrm unmay gdbd paida kr deta hai. Dhrm kuch acche is aam krwata hai kuch bure bhi krwata hai. Main iski baat say agree ki insaan a certain dhrm bura. Yahi sacchai hai. Baraber g tum modi aur yogi ki aulad ho na to  islam dharam to galat honahi hai This is not a general mind set.. he is not the representative of all .. Islam is evil Lol, Putin is an Anti-Muslim ? I&#39;m a Hindu who converted to Islam and it&#39;s been great Putin doent have a anti islam image..get your facts right. भाई ने सर ऊंचा कर दिया, वो सत्य कहा जो दलाल मीडिया कहने की हिम्मत नहीं करता। मैं तो रिपोर्टर की सोच रहा हूं, बेचारा कुछ हिंसक और नफ़रत भरी बात ढूंढ रहा था, पर बन्दे ने तर्क का तमाचा मार दिया। Har har mahadev I am Hindu and I am nationalist... Mosques claims are almost real.. I am also a hindu nationalists and I am proud of it....<br><br>These rascals like the diplomat the quint the print and the wire are trying to defame our culture and our religion. I think this man had put a tight slap on their face....<br><br>Jay hind jay bharat jay hindutva...... Hindu gandus Gar marao start dekhne ke bad ab sunne ka man nahi h . You should also show how Christianity and islam became most followed religions in the world. Islam and Christianity believe in forcible convertions but hinduism and Buddhism does not believe in it. Most of the people around the world are forcibly converted to islam and Christianity. Hinduism is a religion of peace and equality but it gita also teaches to protect our Dharma. Fuck you DIPLOMAT Adharam ka jawab adharam nhi hota - Shri Kishan (Mahabharat) Dharam k thekaydaro insaneyat nahi too dharam kysa adhura education graduate nahi banata. Fucking Mad I am Christian but I support Hindus. Just compare extremism of Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Jews with Muslims. U will come to know Islamic extremism is way more dangerous than all of them combined. Those extremisms are nothing before Islamic extremism. Extremist Muslims will directly behead infidels. They will have to chop off non-believer&#39;s hands, legs according to Quran. There is no place for non-muslims in Islam, ex. Asia Bibi case in Pakistan. This is Wisdom...

Does anyone go to Europe and ask &quot;Why are so many European Whites in the majority here?&quot; Does anyone go over to Arabia and Ask &quot;Why are so many Arabs over here?&quot; Then why does the Hindu have to bend and crawl to justify his existence in India?

Har har Mahadev... Jay mathadi... Ahinso paramo dharmaha... Hinduism is great... I do appreciate this guy because he is in RSS not like blind bhakts he is in party Most of the Muslims and Christian Attacks are fake and propagated by Media.  100% Real Attack on Muslims and Christian happens as a reaction not as a revenge . If you someone slap you , You will slap him too. Even if you are weak, If some someone slap you again and again , At the end, You will slap back. <br><br>Muslims and Christian missionaries openly do chutiyapa on street and create trouble for society. <br><br>My Personal Opinion is : Muslims and Christians , Follow the rules and forget about converting hindus  Else Leave our nation. No special rules for you. Abe sadiyal gadhe, tu bol raha hai islam ke aane ke baad ladkiya chedi gayi... Ek baar, mahabharat padh ke dekh... Teri un kitabon me bhi duryodhan ki chedkhani aur raava ki jurrat sahi tarike se darshaya gaya hai... Ye tho islam aane ke baad.. Ladkiyo ko dhak kar izzat dilvaya gay... Suwar khaanewaale.. Pehle padh.. Phir baat kar.. Modi yogi ny tu or gaand maarli hinduo ki Christianity  prithbi ko shant rakh ne ke liye  jaruri ha. Jo Christianity  ko janta nehi ha o murkh ha. He&#39;s speaking truth This guy is ignorant on so many levels. <br>Just one question out of thousands..<br>Did Islam taught you to burn your women alive too?? These Muslims know that They can&#39;t take over a country through violence and jihad, so now they collaborate with liberals, socialists and communists to create rift between the citizens and destroy an country from the inside. They know they the media and all social media will support liberals and pseudo progressives, we can see it happening around the world, mass immigration to Europe, leftist violence in USA and destroying the sanctity of a temple in India. This Video title name should be &quot;The reality of hindu&quot; instead of &quot;The mind of hindu&quot; Isko ilaj ki jarurat he. A mental he nationalist nahi. Deshko todneka kam kar rahahe a log. Can anybody tell me , what incorrect facts he has told . He is 100 % true . I have read both Quran , and Bible , this Abrahmic God , mentioned in those two books , cannot be a normal human Being , forget about it being God . It is so vindictive and vengeful , who wants it self to be worshiped , and its followers to spread it around , until no other religion is left . Where is philosophy , righteousness in those two  books , They are merely dogmas ,to subjugate humanity ,  with socio political motives  .   An Abrahmic faith follower can not be secular , if he becomes secular , he ceases to be Muslim or Christianity . The  Europe is discussing , that Jesus is fiction , no such historical person named Jesus ever existed , the Bible itself has been edited in ancient times . Both the faiths have spread by swords  or deceit , killing the native faiths of Europe , Persia , America , Africa .<br>Both Christianity and Islam , has been disaster for humanity . Before Christianity , Europe gave birth to Great ancient Civilizations like Rome ., Greek etc , as soon as Jesus start washing European Sins , it plunged in to dark ages for 1000 years , very much like Islamic countries are today , success of Europe is due revolt against Christianity , Remember the  struggles of Copernicus , Galelio , French revolution . If  Islam , and Christianity are two religions , than Hindus have 100&#39;s of religions within its fold of Hindu Umbrella .Can anyone tell me when do these different school of thoughts of Hindus have killed each other . Islam , Christianity intra religious violence histroy is obvious , Shia - Sunni&#39;s are still fighting , Catholic , and protestant blood bath in Europe is well known during medieval times . Look at the hipocracy , Christians , Jews , Muslims worship the same Abrahmic God , only postman( Prohpet ) are different , still they have the historic record of Jehad - Crusade fight , which continues to this day , They make fun of Hindus having 33 crore Gods , still the worshipers of 33 crore different  Gods , call themselves belonging to same religion . Abrahmic faiths teaches exclusivity , and issue of Communal ism came to India with arrival of Christianity and Islam , If one study old  testament and Quran    , he will realize  that Quran , is not a new book , but next edition of Old Testament , but on Steroids . How much secularism , Democracy , Territorial unity does Pakistan have . India is one unit , democracy , secular ,because it is Hindu . You make it a Islamic  or Christian  country  , all the three will disappear .<br>By taking his interview as a friend  and later portraying him a evil , the news Channel has exposed its shallow level of ethics , intellectual understanding , perhaps the concerned  journalist could not find any other job , and ending up becoming journalist . Even if the journalist have downloaded the Quran , Bible , and read it for a week , He or She could have done better .<br>Any way the journalists have made good mockery of themselves , which is amply evident from the comment box of readers . hope you would better next time . I&#39;m not Hindu...... Bt I find reality in his words. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a> <br> Does that mean if I kicked/punched someone, will you start blaming it to WWE/UFC ? Its only our culture where we call our land motherland...that means our ancestors gave more importance to female....and yes back in early vedic days both male and female had equal rights.... nowhere in time  we believed in supremacy and we believed in equal rights of both men and women... that&#39;s why our goddess of education is also a female deity He is saying good talk bilkul sahi kaha bhai NE desh or duniya kai Islam kahtarnak hai Haaan true aap logo ka ram Mandir banwa de modi ne shame on There are 5.3k sane people in india for every 8.4k khaki knicker clads. Hope still prevails. Hahahaha<br>Fool guy, really mentality sick people. He need Sicerstic. laughable &quot;thanks&quot; diplomat!! this shows hindu nationalists want to end poverty! now compare it with islamic extremists they fucking kill people damn it!! Hehehe....... He is a complete fool  . 😂 Har har Mahadev Sahi hai This is why modi won because we hindus believe in forgiving and dwelling in present. Islam is a political ideology.<br>Not a dharm Peaceful religion 😂😂😂 Right sir Chutiya saala gandu The answer to the title is Tatti 💩 I support this guy in every point and I will stand by it if you don&#39;t agree to go live in Pakistan for one year and tell me to rethink🙏 I agree with ur words Sour ki shakel hai tare Pahle gai ka gobar kha fir baat karo Before Islam there was no world islam came from when the man step foot on Earth 1400 Quran was a revolution to Mohammed (saw) who is the final messenger of almighty Why don&#39;t we resolve all the religion....and known to be a simple human Ye aadmi duniya ka sabse badha zaahil hey..isko kuch nahi pata ..isko apne dharam ke bare mein nahi pata hoga..chutiya Great Hindu, thanks for bringing this video. Long live Hindu Rashtra. Fuck-Off your Bastard ! vai mai tu insaan hu khaali... mei baach gya en sab se... Hindus are awesome.....proud to be hindu......jai kara veer bajrangi...har har mahadev... Now if this a mindset of a normal educated nationalist. Now guess the mindset of an uneducated one... We are definitely going back wards.. Treat the Indian Muslims like the same as in China. Saab maaze karo. I am Nepali Hindu Nationalist. Nepal used to be Hindu nation until 2006 but our corrupt politicians changed country to secularism for their own benefit. Jay shree Krishna. Om. congress is corrupt humare country me svayamvar tha pehle jaha ladkia khud ladke ko pasand karti thi His first line is 100% true <br>Islam and Christianity caused violence and injustice in world at a great level. <br>Like World war 1 <br>World war 2 <br>Isis <br>World Trade centre  <br>Killing of jews <br>Forced conversion all over indian subcontinent. <br>Irradiation of Parsis or Persians. <br>Honor killings. hindus they dont only care about humans but they also care about all living beings by not killing them &quot;Vasudaiva Kutumbakum&quot; (Earth is one family)<br><br>As a Hindu, I would like to say, We can&#39;t change our History, but we can change consequences from History. Every human being wants to leave a peaceful life. Being identified by religion, race doesn&#39;t brings peace to this world, everyone must understood that no one is above or below to us. We are all capable in a unique way &amp; we must share that uniqueness within each of us. Ya madrchud gaddar Pakistan Hindu h India Hindu nhi ya madrchud gaddar ganda Hindu hinduvt atnakwad gurup rss or Hindu dall Hindu bhanee bajrang dal vhp rss ke tarning cumpe chal rah h India m India gormant sapot karta h madrchud gaddar ganda Hindu Pakistan Proud to be Hindu and now huum force Sai apnii chizzo koo lengai and huuk Sai lengai Jai Shri Ram He is saying write you people are making this documentary misguiding but we are Hindu and we are totally educated and we are now unite and fully nationalist. <br>Now days come so we will make India total Hindu nation. Ye itni confidence Bible ke bare main jhooth bol raha hai...Kabhi Bible padhi bhi nahin hai isne aur itne confidence se jhooth faila raha hai hahahah sirf hasi aati hai aise logo ki soch par गांधी वाद मे हिंसा का मतलब जानबूझकर किसी को ,बिना मतलब मारना है ।किसी के हमले से अपने को बचाने के लिए लड़ना गांधीवाद है। आंदोलन मे पुलिस का विरोध सिर्फ इसलिए नहीं किया जाता था कि उससे  आंदोलन का मुख्य उद्देश्य से ध्यान हट जाता था और अंग्रेजों द्वारा किये गये लाठीचार्ज आदि को न्यायोचित होने का दर्जा प्राप्त हो जाता। After all it happened to you, you still remain calm and compose ..Proud of being Hindu. We survived so many attacks since our existence ... he is not a hindu nationalist he is a bjp worker.....aur mai ek hindu nationalist hu par mai BJP ko support nehi karta... Scary. The way he talks about violence. ye madar ........ rss wale desh ko barbaad kar ke rahenge😡 Hindu by grace of the god You are right Geeta says &quot;dharma rakshti rakshitahh....&quot; arthat If you will protect religion.. religion will protect u. I m a educated bt without any shame I will stand for Hinduism up to the last breath. Islam and christianity are incurable diseases... Stop misinterpreting Hindutva Jhoot hain yeh sub baatain kahin bhe nahi likha hua quraan me kisi bhe hindu ko maro kyu aisa ghalath bolrai Bhai. Bas kero bhai hindu Muslim ka ghada <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m39s\">6:39</a> true On one hand he is speaking against other relegions... And when talk about women&#39;s issues he says he have a influence of other relegions.. Uh man what he wants to say....  Secularism word.... Hahhhaa.....  Jesus christ gave his physical body and beared the pain to save humanity or if had nithing to do with that he must had left his followers who deceived him...  Just to taught us lesson he accepted that...i am a sikh but know wgat is humanity.. every relegion taught  us same but defination changes if person uses uses it according to his thought process Correct I pity his thoughts but its not all his fault <br>Its process of ignorance, misunderstanding <br>That has took place amongst us for centuries.<br>But we can still pray for a unite India also a India free of hate. Mahilao k sath sath in logo ko bhi thoda siksha de do Sbi Hindu ki yee soch nhi haii ऎतिहासिक तथ्यों के आधार पर सभी बातें सत्य है। हिन्दू अपने नैसर्गिक संस्कारो की वजह से अहिंसक और सहिष्ण होता है और इसमें धर्म परिवर्तन को कोई प्रोत्साहन नही है क्योंकि यह धर्म अन्य सभी धर्मों को मान्यता देता है। बाकी ये दोनों धर्म,  धर्म परिवर्तन और अन्य धर्मों की निंदा पर आधारित है। और इन दोनों धर्मो का मुख्य उद्देश्य हिन्दुओ को धर्म परिवर्तन कर जड़ से खत्म कर देना है। All in the comments are happy when the guy taking tells you what you want to hear. That not Hinduism. That&#39;s just satisfying your ego. 💯 % correct bro minority religions are creating lot of violence whenever they are in majority 👹👹👹💩💩💩  and 5k dislikes  are Pakistani namards Always forgive but never forget. excilent script amazing acting WHO ARE THESE SCHOLARS? LET ME SAY NO MOST SCHOLARS AGREE. i would like the same reporter to go to the no go zones of Europe and USA, forget, middle east for the time being. wow what a propaganda video Q: Why do Hindus hate muslims so much?<br>A: Because they have spent the most time with them and know them well. Europe and the US have just begun to get a taste of it and you can tell islamophobia is on the rise.<br>Every time there&#39;s a terrorist attack in the US or Europe, or when another of those muslim grooming gangs is caught, Indians get the feeling of deja vu. <br>Many times India tried to bring the UN and worldwide attention to the magic of Islam, but they all were like, &quot;Oh man, not again. You silly third-worlders just hate each other. Here&#39;s some money. You two boys now go outside and get yourself an ice-cream.&quot; He should be name Chutiest😂😂. Knows nothing about islam and explaining us about islam and muslims. Islam is true religion. Love you islam I just want to question u.<br>Why you killed thousands of muslims in gujrat roits.<br>Why do you killed lakhs of people in kashmir.<br>Why do u killed thousands of sikhs after indra ghandi was assisinated.<br>Why do u killed so many people in nagaland. <br>Why why r u not addressing these events. Getting religion in front of crime is a crime itself so why. I m also a Hindu nationalist and I m proud of it.

Articulate representatives of various regional zeitgeist. For this part of the world, we get this in very few places Chor cheenal ka nonsensical propaganda. Devadasi system Intolerance Waahhhhhh U the hell are u. Very toxic mind I&#39;d say. Totally wrong interpretation of the bible, I dont know where did he hear or see such t.v shows. The Bible teaches love, it says &quot;Love your enemy&quot;, it does not allow revenge, it says, if someone hits you in one cheek show your other cheek. Mahatma Gandhi gets this from the bible. These people should read more, anyone can have opinion but not change the facts.<br>India will probably go backwards like this. A hindu nationalist is a psycopath who ironically believes that nationalism will be driven by hatred towards others in the name of religion inherited to them by their forefathers. Ridiculous! Nice approximately 600 years india was ruled by Muslims if they wanted they could have killed every hindu in India because it was monarch rule but the period of 600 year is called the golden era in Indian history from GDP to architecture everything was built in this time after British took control you can still see the effects of British rule still in India thousands are dieing due to hunger. RSS separate hate in your society<br>I am not agree with this moron The Mind of an Indian Nationalist* Absolutely right bro I&#39;m a Hindu nationalist.

WE ARE INDIANS. WE, HINDUS AND MUSLIMS FAUGHT TOGETHER FOR THE INDEPENDENCE AND NOW WE WANT TO MAKE THE COUNTRY HIGH…<br><br>One should understand: Indian sub-continent had been under the rule of Muslim empires and kings for more than eight centuries – still they didn’t destroy any Hindu temple, they didn’t convert anyone to Islam forcefully. The conversions to Islam were due to the mishandling and torturing of “low class” Hindus by high class as a part of their belief (all the history books written by Indians and foreigners underlines the fact).<br>All the basic human rights of Hindu low-class and women were given by Muslim rulers. Because, Muslim rulers considered all as equal and humans. <br>IN CERTAIN PARTS – I HAVE SEEN, THERE ARE LOW CLASS PEOPLE STILL, NOT PERMITTED TO COVER THEIR BREASTS, TO WEAR CHAPPALS, TO ENTER TEMPLES ETC.<br><br>Even the idea of Indian partition raised first by extreme hind us as early as 1920s<br>Reservation in government jobs are not for all Muslims, instead it is for socially and educationally backward people. There are a lot of Muslims who are not entitled for reservation. And 99% of people enjoying reservation are low-class, and financially backward Hindus. <br>More than 90% of Indians (including Brahmins) hate the extremist Hindus (even the current ruling coalition have support of only less than 30% of Indians as of 2014 – and that was too, due to political reasons. Now they don’t have even 5% support)<br><br>The paramilitary groups of extremist groups like RSS, VHP etc are terrorizing people and threatening their life if they speak against. A lot of people who spoke against their ideology have been brutally killed.<br>Extreme groups are re-writing the history, and spreading lies and hatred million times. It reached to such an extremity that they claim: ancient Indian Hindu saints had internet facilities, aero-planes and so on. These are not being spread by people like this man, but by the ministers, parliament members and governors! THE FACT IS THAT, THESE ARE ALL THE PRODUCT OF BRAINWASHING <br><br>You should think what these extreme people did with other religions of Indian sub-continent origin like Buddha, Sikh, Jain etc.<br>They are trying to mix all – politics, economical – or any incidents (even road accidents) with religion. This is the consequence of extremist policy in poisoning people at a younger age – catch them young policy.<br>Hindus and Muslims were united in freedom struggle, and these extremists were against it.<br>Well,  now do you think, whatever, they are doing any good for at least Hindus? Or at least for its supporters? NO, THEY DID NOTHING EXCEPT CURREPTION AND VIOLENCE. INDIA BECAME A COUNTRY WITH A LOW QUALITY OF LIFE, LOW EDUCATION QUALITY ETC. FALSE DATA ARE BEING SHOWN. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER IDENTIFY THE FACT. There are a lot to say.<br>Footnote: NOW THEY WILL COME TO THREATEN ME, AND TO MAKE ME ANTI-INDIAN! CHECK THE LIST OF TRAITORS AND SPIES CAUGHT SO FAR… ALL OF THEM FALL TO YOUR MEMBERS LIST!

Nowhere it is written in the bible that you should stone unbelievers, that is fake news This Desi man is the mountain of ignorance but reporter is one who is constructing this mountain taller and bigger by posting such cheap thoughts of a cheap guy. To fill belly some are ready to sell everything. People who have only toungue but no soul are like moving dead bodies. Only this way indian society will progress - indian muslims (india is best country in the world muslims are secure there, best of luck next 5-10yrs under modi gov)😂😂😂 This is wrong, Christianity never said that, the correct verse is,&quot; a parent should stoned a disobedient child, rather than growing it up into a sinner&quot;. I am a former hindu now a Christian, and hinduism is one of the most violent and a religions that does not make much sense. Also talk about the castes in hindu society. <br>This mentality is the facist mentality. India was secular and will be secular country. <br>Sab sath milkar hi rahenge. U ignorant it&#39;s Constantine ..second u are quoting verses of Quran out of context ,those verses were meant for that time and that was after non Muslims violated agreement wth Muslims ...u are displaying ur ignorance Absolutely perfect This is exactly what Indian media, families and government teach their people. We have close relations with every other South Asian country but India is a paranoid terrorist country. They&#39;re creating 1.4 billion terrorists. I feel bad for these brainwashed idiots.<br><br>Putin is anti-Muslim? Why are there almost 30million Muslims in Russia? The German Chancellor is anti-Muslim? In Germany and Europe they say she&#39;s pro-Muslim. This guy is extremely uneducated. His parents groomed him to become a terrorist.

It is also the one considered most sacred by the Hindus.

Many of these are mentioned in Rigveda Book 2 hymn 1.<br><br>Among the various attributes of God, one of the beautiful attributes mentioned in the Rigveda Book II hymn 1 verse 3, is Brahma. Brahma means ‘The Creator’. Translated into Arabic it means Khaaliq. Muslims can have no objection if Almighty God is referred to as Khaaliq or ‘Creator’ or Brahma. However if it is said that Brahma is Almighty God who has four heads with each head having a crown, Muslims take strong exception to it.<br><br>Describing Almighty God in anthropomorphic terms also goes against the following verse of Yajurveda: <br><br>&quot;Na tasya Pratima asti&quot;<br>&quot;There is no image of Him.&quot;<br>              [Yajurveda 32:3]<br><br>Another beautiful attribute of God mentioned in the Rigveda Book II hymn 1 verse 3 is Vishnu. Vishnu means ‘The Sustainer’. Translated into Arabic it means Rabb. Again, Muslims can have no objection if Almighty God is referred to as Rabb or &#39;Sustainer&#39; or Vishnu. But the popular image of<br> <br><br>9[Atharveda Samhita vol 2 William Dwight Whitney page 910]<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>Vishnu among Hindus, is that of a God who has four arms, with one of the right arms holding the Chakra, i.e. a discus and one of the left arms holding a ‘conch shell’, or riding a bird or reclining on a snake couch. Muslims can never accept any image of God. As mentioned earlier this also goes against Svetasvatara Upanishad Chapter 4 verse 19.<br><br>&quot;Na tasya pratima asti&quot;<br>&quot;There is no likeness of Him&quot;<br><br>The following verse from the Rigveda Book 8, hymn 1, verse 1 refer to the Unity and Glory of the Supreme Being:<br><br>&quot;Ma cid anyad vi sansata sakhayo ma rishanyata&quot;<br>&quot;O friends, do not worship anybody but Him, the Divine One.

He is to an extent right in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m28s\">6:28</a>. During ancient Indian times when Hinduism was prevalent, women had equal rights with men and women were allowed to choose their husbands. Dowry and Sati were not a part of Hinduism. There were several matriarchal societies in Ancient India. Colonization by Islamic Empires started during the medieval period, which deteriorated women&#39;s status. I&#39;m not saying Islam is sexist, but the culture of the Islamic empires that colonized India were sexist and that is probably how India became sexist. He is telling the truth only. Completely agree with this guy..<br>Whatever he said accept or not but true. Hindus just want to protect their religion in their native land, just like the Jews want to protect Judaism in Israel. Western propaganda and money is trying to convert the masses to Christianity while Islamic terrorist groups do likewise for Islam.

Bhaga diya Mahabharat teaches the role of women and men and how they are both equally important. Ek number ka chutiya hai yeh! A Hindu nationalist?  I see a shit-filled skull only. We can easily conclude (leave the fact that if he was factually correct or wrong) that these so called Hindu nationalist (or fundamentalists whatever you call) wants mere equality with all religions. Whereas look at other religion fundamentalists, they want their religion supremacy... That&#39;s the difference.... Comment your opinion Neither all Muslims are bad nor all Hindus are Good.

India has higher statistical poverty than Pakistan. 💯 right. हिंदू जाग रहा है.<br>हिंदू एकता.<br>हर हर महादेव Christianity and Islam are destroying our Nation Lol go back to pakistan where you came from. i wonder how much he was paid to say all this bullshit YOU GIVE REFERNCE OUT OF CONTECT, CONVERT ME IN HINDUISM IF YOU SHOW ME ONE WORD, WHERE MAHVEER , GHANISHA KRISHNA RAAM OR 35000000 GODS  SAID WE CREATED MANKIND EARTH SUN MOON BILLIONS OF PLANETS UNIVERSE AND HEAVENS, PLZ SHOW ME ONE VERSE IN WHEN AND WHERE ANY HINDU GOD SAID, I AM GOD, I can say with confidence that what the guy said is raw in nature and true in essence, anyone who do not understand it is just naive OK so there&#39;s too much corruption, and people are having problems, the government is Hindu and so are the richest of Hindu. so they blame the Muslims, haha wow this inbred doesn&#39;t even have logic, just like ghandi who slept with his own niece naked एक एक बात सच बोली है बंदे ने ये गंदगी इस्लाम के साथ ही भारत आई है। Confused - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=05m20s\">05:20</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=05m30s\">05:30</a>. That proves that this man has made decisions of his life and character based on his ancestors and media. Islam se dushmani hai, musalmaan se nahi, par marenge musalmaan ko. Confused people are RIGHTly ruled and others are LEFT out. Prove me wrong Countries with most religious unrest <br>Well you have something common in all those countries.....<br>Its not hindu or Christian  BTW You can see which people are danger to the nation. 4.9k Dislikes from those kind of people. JAY Shree ram .. awesome ... Bollywood actors disliked this video... this hatred among our fellow citizens is mainly because everyone (all religions included) here are not ready to leave what has happened in past , using this both right and left extremists are exploiting us all for their own all kinds of benefit , we will not develop unless and until we all strive together to get rid of these elements aur ek baat partition hue kayi saal hogaye hai and we chose india as our homeland and i am proud that my grandfather made that choice so just pls taane maarne band kardo ... proud to be indian jai hind. Madarsa me camera le jao <br>Ak47 dikhenge...bas that , great indian  thought  all cast respect bible padha hi nahi lol and bible was written by multiple people , can understand where is coming from hahahahah This person is talking fact.... Don&#39;t ever use guru gobind singh ji name with that mouth ...i wish u was in pujab saying all that shit, then we would have taught u lessonb.tell this piece of shit that don&#39;t relate urself with sikhism....sikh condem hindu nationalists..we just hate people like this...in this era we will alwasy prefer muslim and christian as are main frnds then hindu&#39;s like this.....once more don&#39;t relate urself with sikhism...u don&#39;t diserve sikh name... very good..i respect gandhi ji very much but i respect Raju Guru, Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev and Chandra Shekhar Azad. a person should act according to situation . Jai sriram jai hanuman This guy is clearly ignorant, illiterate and stupid and his thoughts &amp; belief are really dangerous (probably because of his upbringing) ..educated people don&#39;t just quote holy books and say things publicly (there is a method to interpret holy books : Hermeneutic). He is humiliating himself and his community with a very little knowledge he thinks he&#39;s got. Little knowledge is very dangerous my country man. If you can&#39;t even understand the politics of what really happened during the partition period, how in the hell do you think you can interpret the holy Quran and the bible. By saying all that, you are simply expressing your hatred towards other community...Clearly, you are speaking not out of influence of Hinduism, but out of your leaders influences..because, Hindu religion doesn&#39;t teach you that (to hate other community in whatsoever form)..your leaders does. How come no one realized here that this magazine indirectly tried to malign the image of India and portrayed the Hindu ideas in a low light by running &#39;so-believed&#39; informative clips in the intervals..???<br>It seems as if every one from all walks of life are on mission to defame Hindus....Everyone wants Hindus to get extinct, to get converted and irony is that none other than Hindus only are supporting their cause...!!!<br>Well that&#39;s now where one must realize how powerful is the effect of education which one receives...studying in convent school how could you expect them to talk good about SANATAN dharm.....we are being brain washed in the name of Secularism Liberalism and what not and forced to directly or indirectly believe in JESUS..

This man was taught hatred and he pouring hatred out. Every religion has good and bad people, we should be the good one. What is talking about Christian is wrong . Starting  killing  muslim and Christian  in india Extremely crystal clear mindset, if every hindu adopt this clear mindset then Bharat will be most prosporous nation in the whole world. <br><br>Weak and confused mindset of hindus are the reason for the corruption and chaos in India. Religion is the worst thing that ever happened to humanity India and Pakistan are wannabes shit countries stupid people fighting over religion   political parties wannabe whites nafrat ki aag me mar jaoge ek din, chalo achha hai thodi population kam ho jayei take interviews of some responsible person, or be yourself responsible. aur jaha tak ladki chhedne ki baat hai, uski shuruwat Hindu religiion me hui hai Draupati se. Dont talk dirty about any religion blindly. There is some fault in everythng, evven in the GOD . Look people mind set, even on the comments section 😡. This clearly shows the difference between North indians and South indians. Only Northies can think like this (not every north indians). Shame, shame.... Hahaha whenever I see Hindu or moorkh bhakt I understand how they afraid how they feel fear ....is liye 15 minutes kofy he now why I agree with Akbaruddin time to defend my home my land my family &quot; Most scholars say &quot; who are the most scholars dammit any one writes a book and moulds and facts as they wish ...😑😑😑 He&#39;s so correct He&#39;s a paid guy ... like always foreign media always trying to defame India ya sala chutiya Bjp RSS kutta hai sala sahi hai bhai What&#39;s wrong he said ..... Great video Did you see when he was saying Draupadi married 5 times, there is a text appeared on the upper side which says &quot;unsubstantiated claim&quot; fuck you The diplomatic bitches Hindus had sathis....... Killing widows............. How can this man even tell lies with a laughing face???? Bible was printed after 1700 years  ......not written Look at ur fairy tale books....... Where ur gods are raping women and promoting violence by saying that Enmys are enmys....... Look at ur side u love India jus because ur a Hindu???? We are following differnt religions but we are taught to be patriotic towards our motherland....... And bible has not said to stone our brothers to death but said those who with no sins shall have the right to stone to death others The only thing that I agree is that reservation. There will be much better, smarter people who couldn&#39;t a seat because of reservation and I find just banning the slaughter of cows kind of funny. If you are banning slaughter ban slaughter of all animals. Its like saying Muslims don&#39;t  eat pork so nobody else should eat. Its kinda dumb. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to say. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the problem n being a nationalist.isnt it good? He is GodseVadi😂😂😂 BRUTAL. HONEST. GOOD! dude there is nothing of the sort which you mentioned about christians related to throwing stones and killing a person if he doesn&#39;t not believe . Nothing of that sort is written anywhere in bible... don&#39;t spread lies for God&#39;s sake.. RSS ka kutta hai WAH 100% right my brother I agree with everything he said about Islam and Hinduism but not about Christianity. The religion has evolved a lot and what he said about conversions is highly rare, limited to only rural and uneducated people. Christianity doesn&#39;t tell you to be anti Indian or to consider other gods  fake. Thanks god u r not americans otherwise there will b no southasian community out there...<br>Bro its not u r fault u have been told do us... So according to him All the religion is wrong except Hinduism.. Lol Respect him for being truthful on his belief even though it’s against and opposing others <br>But that’s how a dialogue can be started because he is not two faced <br>Saying something and doing the other thing Stupid man. I m just laughing on the lowest intellectual level oh this man... He didn&#39;t even read anythng about that.. Every word is self made by him... 😂😂 Jai Sri Ram The Diplomat, make videos on the muslim mindset and violence, anti nationalism, islamic propaganda, to name a few associated with the muslims. You&#39;ll NEVER dare to do that! This guy is spot on and telling just the bitter truth that you can not swallow! BC YE NI SAMAJH ME AYA ISME GALAT KYA BOLA ISNE...<br>SECULARISM KE NAM PE APNI MARWATE RAHE KYA.... Unsubstantiated claim at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m40s\">6:40</a> why I think the Admin is katua means he is mushlim... he is saying right at around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m40s\">6:40</a> I wonder such idiots exist in the world. Who is akash bhatiya .. ? The guy is blaming everything wrong with India to Muslims and Islam. Maybe he should check out the Mughal rule in India, it was not perfect neither completely Islamic but India was a far better place than it is today. India had a really strong economy and a strong army. As far as the Islam is concerned Islam nowhere says that don’t educate girls but instead it puts a lot of emphasis on education of both men and women. And nowhere Islam says that go and disturb non-muslims, they can build their places of worship and can preach their religion in a Islamic state. I assure you that this guy doesn’t know even 1% of Islam because I’m a student Islam and everything he said about Islam it contradicts with what I’ve learned. I’m happy to provide proofs that this guy is wrong about Islam. By the way I’ve a very close christian friend. News flash: Nowhere in the bible does it say to stone non-christians.. it says some questionable things, but thats not one of them.. *hindutva not hindu wah bahut badhiya bahut accha gyan diya Ye aadmi bahut sahi baat kar raha hai So what ? India is still going to be a Muslim country with in next 20 years. You realize that what he said about Quran and Bible, the same applies to Gita where you conveniently get ready to pick up arms in the name of Dharma. Scriptures and religions are not wrong, people interpreting them is what causes the trouble. एक पत्थर चोट खाकर कंकड़ कंकड़ हो गया और एक पत्थर चोट सह के शंकर शंकर हो गया Islam Ko thopa Gaya hai Hindustan par or Islam ne Hindustan ke do tukde kiye hai ,or lako logo ki talavar ke Bal par muslim Banya hai , I wonder why we secular south indians are dragged into this nonsense. The north indians hindu and muslims will keep fighting forever and drag us also into this unwanted conflict. Welcome to south ... believe what you want, eat what you want, worship whoever you want... and even if you don&#39;t want worship anyone, you are welcome.

Hindus kill hindus in Mahabharata n Ramayan, how is Hinduism non-violent. <br>where was RSS during sikh, kp riots...wat assistance they gave. Everyone knows they too were involved. <br>There is no such thing in bible. Where it says brother should be stoned to death.<br>Even Hinduism killed rival religion opponents. They massacred Buddhists n turned India into vedic Brahminism. Later Hinduism was United into few sects just to look majoritarian n powerful. Guy lost his home so now wants war in our land. <br>Such false propaganda. Chutiya got such false education.<br>Draupadi is goddess. Lol thats why her brothers raped her n husbands surrendered her. He is saying society is matriarchal. Lol. So was harem n educational institution.

Unfortunately that would happen in the next 20 to 50 years and by that time the most promising part of my life(and most of us) would be over, and it would have been lived under a shadow of violence &amp; hatred which would annihilate a lot of my opportunities for happiness &amp; contentment. In short life would be rendered a partial waste. It would not proceed to what any human life should, but be mired in nonsensical &amp; damaging pursuits imposed by society&#39;s foolish, malicious and sub-human elements. Right now these people need to stop thinking in terms of us and them and bring out their genuine feelings of hurt. They will surely be addressed with love. Instead what they do is propagate a wrong and simplistic worldview and spread hate and vengeance. And when few idiots fight the entire population suffers. This man thinks people are crying out over lynching of beef-smugglers, who indulge in illegal(ahh the audacity) activities. NO, the people are tired of all goonda-ism, VIP-ism, nepotism, corruption, Police harassment, Crony-businessmen, political-business nexus, fraud, and an overall unjust and unfair system. Mob killing of innocents is also part of this list, but people are not outraged that a muslim died, common people are outraged that poor and innocent people are being brutally murdered for nothing. The 4.6K people disliking this video is a farce, a shame. No difference between his worldview and the worldview of a white supremacist or a terrorist group such as ISIS. These are sides of the same coin. Unfortunate and sad If Mauryan dynasty would have stayed for more 1 century then today their would be no Muslim or Britishers in India. The first time India saw death due to famine was under the British He is correct...We dont hate muslims but we hate their ideology... Agar tumhara belief strong hota to Islam ko aane do ya for kisiko bhi tumhare dharm ki niv hi agar galat ho to Kya ho sakta hai Aapka Hindu dharm it a khokla hai Kya ki kisi dusre ke aane se uspar galat prabhav pada are vo andar se khokla dharm hai usme koi bhi logic hi nahi hai islam bhi vaisa hi hai aur Cristina&#39;s bhi same Sir Samrat Ashok  Buddhism me convert ho Gaye the khudke man se he was not Hindu.....

BJP is a scam, why then Modi is going begging with a bowl to all the “muslim &amp; chrisitian countries” asking for funds, since hes elected? Stop this religious &amp; sectoral mindset! Just be humans &amp; see beyond religion,color, language, castes, Just be Humans first &amp; then Indians. He has better knowledge than us......hats off to this man Hell your idealism and hate for others. If India is secular state... Y is there ban on eating beef in certain state.!!!! Shame on u n states.. U defeat t beauty i  Indian secularism and democracy!!! Bible doesn&#39;t tell stone to death... Thats a lie... I know Bible... See v don&#39;t hate u.. Even if u kill us..

Taxi drivers create traffic. This hero calls his BJP politician and then takes a stick and beats up the taxi driver and everything is fine.<br><br>Wow bravo. He is a shame to Hinduism. He is not a real Hindu. yogi and RSS Will be the death of India. and I&#39;m a hindu. There is absolutely no part in the New Testament that says we are supposed to stone non Christians, furthermore the Gospels record that Jesus stopped men that were attempting to stone a women. Which is where we get the phrase, he who is without sin cast the first stone.<br><br>He is conflating Christianity with Islam, which is a serious error. Also Hindu nationalist are the ones attack poor Christians all through out India, many churches have been burned and people killed. Also many face daily intimidation. marvellous speech Got more disgusted after reading the comments 😔 THE SUPPOSED &#39;&#39;UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS&quot; ARE EXTREMELY ACCURATE AND EXTREMELY SUBSTANTIATED. Saala..... RSS ka chamcha...... Agreed and support whole words. Abe chutiye..... Tu bahut bada jaahil h......... Saari batein teri galat h........... The scariest part of this video was the comments section! It is utterly shameful that so many of us have fallen into the trap of xenophobia and hatred for other religions. These people have become the very thing they claim to hate and fight against! Isn&#39;t that why people hate Islam and Christianity? Because they supposedly spread unrest and immorality? Isn&#39;t teaching people to hate on the basis of religion inciting hatred? Isn&#39;t it immoral to judge a group of people based on which God they worship? Hypocrisy, like terrorism, has no religion!<br>This man has been given the wrong kind of education. Hatred has been injected into him, slowly and steadily, like poison, until it consumed him completely. We shouldn&#39;t have more people like him. What is the basis of his hatred? He has random quotes from Quran and Bible. Who knows whether they are even true! I&#39;m sure he hasn&#39;t read either of those books. I&#39;m sure he hasn&#39;t interacted closely with people from any other religion. He is just a frog in the well. Is this what we want our future generation to become? He doesn&#39;t care seem to care about the law at all. Or about other human beings. And yet he is not evil - just brainwashed and taught to hate from a very young age. I can only feel sorry for this man. Such schools should be banned and the venomous people who did this to this man must be hanged! I&#39;m crying.... He is mentally the sick.<br>We need to rebuild 🇮🇳 India.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BasicHumanity\">#BasicHumanity</a> ♥️ And some good parts didn&#39;t get translated right but overall good translation All of this could have been avoided of the British hadn&#39;t created Fackistan He said there was no violence  before the spraed of Islam and Christianity .<br>1.Then tell me a thing when Hanuman have a ability to lift an entire mountain then why he can&#39;t have took sita form Lanka to ayodhya ? So the matter can be closed with simple escape. But it not happend .rama waged a war against ravan and caused death to several civilians death .rama what a great Ahimsa loving personality ? <br>Coming pandavas who is reason for death of 18 lakhs people. While they(pandavas) have to settle there issue  (regarding property ) they may have killed kauravas but they made others to involve in kurukshetra batyle and caused death of many people&#39;s. What a great   way of &#39;peace&#39; making policy ?<br>And the entire kurukshetra battle  episode was eye witnessed by krishna.and  he is called GOD .if he is really A GOD they why don&#39;t he have made good settlement among brothers instead of that brutal violence  (kurukshetra war) .<br>Because here GOD loves  Violence ?.is it what Hindhu dharma teaches to universe? <br>And now a woman love&#39;s and likes her (sita)one and only Husband she (sita )will be sent to jungle and asked to jump into fire. And here comes draupadhi who is wife of 5 Husbands who asks to fight for her prestige. And no bother About own family that a justice ?<br>A Hanuman have ability to teach a lesson to ravan and can take back sita to Ayodhya in a descent way then why did qHanuman have set  fire to common  civilians homes and harassed them in Lanka. What a Justice and what a nonviolent way to settle issue ? <br>Well coming to Ashoka who killed his own 99 brother to become a ruler what appreciable thing naa is it justice? And he killed one lakh people in kalinga war. <br>What a great personality who is called as symbol of &#39;peace &#39;   &#39;shaanthi &#39; He is right if muslims are being beaten up that is because we are angry of muslim appeasement of so called secular parties..and what muslims did with us since last 1000 years..muslims take pride in that..that is ok but now its our phase and you will have to deal with it... I support you One can tell how bogus this report about India being the 4th worst country for religious violence is when you see India &amp; Israel being placed above Pakistan and Afghanistan in the list and countries like Saudi Arabia (where Shia clerics are openly beheaded), Bangladesh (several Hindu and secular bloggers killed) are not even mentioned in the list. Of course you won&#39;t have religious violence in countries like Saudi  because almost no minority religion people live there and those few Christians or Jews living there they have to live as per strict Islamic rules, so there is no religious freedom and hence no scope (or reason) for committing religious violence against minorities. this bogus survey that they show of India being the 4th worst country for religious intolerance, places India above Pakistan where the Hindu population has literally been reduced to less than 1% and Christians are routinely sent to jail on blasphemy laws, recently 2 Chinese nationals were openly killed and Pakistani Govt justified it saying they were doing missionary activity in Taliban area. Recently Pakistan&#39;s Supreme court questioned local authorities why Hindus were not allowed to keep their idols in their temples in Karachi, so apparently a country that does not allow people worship as per their religion is below India in terms of religious intolerance . Hindu and Sikh girls are openly abducted and forcefully married and Bangladesh where several Hindu bloggers are killed and an entire Hindu village people were massacred, even Afghanistan was ranked below India, this shows you how bogus and biased that report about India being 4th is. The real difference between India and Pakistan is that here the media actually does it&#39;s job and highlights cases of religious intolerance against minorities, where as the Pakistani media either does not bother or is too afraid (of terrorists, pak army and police) to properly highlight atrocities happening against minority Sikh, Hindu and Christians in Pak. So the western agencies that compile these reports based on meida reports think that India has more cases of violence against minorities and places it 4th. Matriarchal society mei maata ka he cheerharan....ya right Ok....cheerharan kisne kara tha draupadi ka??musalmaano ne?aur uske 5husband muh dekh rhe the....this man is a joke dude....why would you upload such useless videos and mislead people even further Acha...this man can personally call ministers????seriously?

Haha, Draupadi ko duryodhan chhed he to rha tha :) Kuch bhi :P He could not recall the chapter and verse in Bible coz there is no where written to kill your brother if he does not follow Christianity...and the Bible was written by Jesus&#39;s disciples and not by any king, pls gets ur facts right...in Bible Jesus teaches to you to forgive n pray who does wrong to you...I am a Christian but the biggest commandment for us is to love one another. Liberals will be butt hurt after watching it. I am amazed at the level of ignorance about history and how poorly informed about other religions!  Is it Hindu nationalism? Are we going back to a dark age once again? What does the diplomat mean by Unsubstantiated Claim?? Liked this video because he is 100% Right..!!

Hinduism is the best ever religion in the world can you do a video on &#39; The Mind of a Muslim Extremist&#39; ? Please , i would love to see it . Guys its just another hinduphobic channel , please don&#39;t watch content from this channel . <br>COMPLETELY BLOCKLIST IT what a kind of ill informed person is this. i pity on him In one thing i disagree with him is <br>(Larki cherna islam say aya)<br>Afghanistan may bhi islam hay tho agar waha koi larki cheray us ki zindagi khatam kar detay hay<br>Kisi may bi waha himmat nahi k larki cheray Funny how ALL fundamentalists sound the same, whether Hindu, Jewish, Christian or Muslim.    <br>None will awaken in this life.<br>Only mystics( of any faith) make knowing God more important than religion. Idiot interviewer thought he could uncover some dirty shit. A billion people stand with their guy and he is absolutely right. He didn&#39;t target Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. He knew which religion actually causes disturbances in this world. Ye aadmi bjp it cell se belong karta hai Sorry brother,,, you have wrong information on Islam..... Correct yourself True face of Modi 🆘 press the Link below :<br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/xDzugJ1WiNo\">https://youtu.be/xDzugJ1WiNo</a> Hindus Beat Muslims for not chanting Jay Sri ram <br>meanwhile comment section Hindus don&#39;t force religion very peaceful    ...I said OK Wow, so the mahabharata n Ramayana wars happened after the birth of Christianity? Christianity was limited to south India for 2000 years.. How many wars did Christianity cause in India? Islamic kings killed way many people than the Britishers ever did. And btw the east India company was never a Christian organization.. Their court cases against the English church is also well recorded. These people are so brainwashed to believe so strongly in non-factual bs. Jab tak dharm hai log chutiye bante rahenge😂 well m really ashamed that the indian have such a thinking. the guys knows nothing about islam and he is saying he hates islam. i donno wat he knows about islam that make him hate it. he didt even know the verse properly he was trying to remember. he say eve teasing and rapes started after muslims came...but in india its the hindus who get convicted for rapes and most of the rapes happen in hindu dominant areas. none dares to rape in a muslim dominant areas as they know the consequences if they get caught.<br>further he talked about draupadhi married to 5 men as she was the authority but in mahabharta not a single decision was taken by her. so wat authority he is talking of. she did not even have a right to choose her husband. she was won through the games that princes and kings played to get marrried to her. and if he is such a fan..why dont he share his wife with his brother and make his wife authority.<br>also he says that they wer asked to convert to islam or pay taxes. this is 100% true as for muslim there is zakat and for non muslim they have to pay tax. even today an indian muslim pays both zakat and income tax.<br>one thing i agreed upon him that he said when there is a need to pick up a weapon to fix something...one should do it. and thats wat muslims are doing. the whole world is fighting against muslims not for terrorism but for the oil in those countries. why us or russia is not fighting with saudi arabia which is the only muslim nation which has not been attached or matter of fact indonesia and malasya coz saudi giv3s out their oil freely to the west and malasiya doest have oil. its a common sense. Ye mansik roop se pidit haiii if u have guts interview the mind of islamic nationalists, as a common Indian I can agree with most of his points Nice propaganda Support to Hindus You are telling as he is an alien Smart guy. 😊👍 Half of the video is &quot;Unsubstantiated Claim&quot;.<br><br>Well Guess what ? So is everything claimed by Islam and Christianity :<br><br>-  Jesus walking on Water (&quot;Unsubstantiated Claim&quot;)<br>- Jesus raising from the Dead (&quot;Unsubstantiated Claim&quot;)<br>- Prophet Muhammad flying on Donkey (&quot;Unsubstantiated Claim&quot;)<br>- Existence of Only One God (&quot;Unsubstantiated Claim&quot;)<br>- Concept of Heaven and Hell (&quot;Unsubstantiated Claim&quot;)<br>- Idol worship being forbidden (&quot;Unsubstantiated Claim&quot;)<br><br>How&#39;s that ? Two can play this game !!! RSS mindset is what is destroying india not Islam or Christianity ... Very articulate man I  dont  think   this  guy  represent   the  whole  indians   basically  mostely  indians  r  good  people The unbiased nature of the video could be gauged from the likes and dislikes it gets and you&#39;re video amply portrays it. Great. Reporting standards of The Diplomat!! How dare you dare talk about Punjab, You are not fucking punjabi We love All religions and Specially all of Our Pakistani and Punjabi Muslim brothers. Now fuck off! Now make a video about Muslim mind to know whether his claims are true Bilkul sahi bola sir apne. Hum sab apke support mai hai Oh bhai I am a Muslim and I can tell you Quran mai aesa kuch nai likha. And as far as the rape thing goes, agar India mai Islam k baad rapes shuru hue tou why is India known as the rape capital of the world? Why not other Muslim countries like Pakistan, UAE, Saudi Arabia? these channels only put side of Hindus, and always shows Hindus as culprit and Muslim as victim,  why they never show side of Muslim,  i know why,  because they fear of Islam, every single world  is true. most Indians can relate to this. BJP has also left the hindu cause hence this feeling prevail. Wow islam ki wjha se Ldki tm chhydny lgy ho. Islamic Countries me ye kam nhi htaa leki hindu islam ki wjha se Ldki chhydty hyn. wah hindu bnye. Jb Islam aya thaa us wqt Arab k andr Log apnii betion ko Zinda Dfn kr dete thyy.Islam ny unhein izzat dii. <br>Tmhare india k andr Log womens ko Zinda jala dete thyy apny husband ki dead body k sath. or tu kia baat kr rhaa hy.

Doosron ka doodh bhii tmhein kala nzr aye ga Wow. Devi ka rape in public Iam muslim I clearly argue that Islam is only meant for peace...the verses from Quran (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=1m56s\">1:56</a> min)is a small part which is misleading....if we take the entire ayah and it&#39;s meaning we can clearly know the truth @The Diplomat<br>can you mention the verse please which Aakash is talking about (at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=01m55s\">01:55</a> min). Proud Hindu not pseudo-secular hinduism apart what about dalits. Are they not Hindu. Dalits and dravidian ancestry goes back to Indus valley civilization, Iron age. At that time there was no hindu or aryans. Hinduism was started in Vedic era in Ganges platue not on Indus. so why are dalits are been killed Please wake up Hindus ! Sleep is enough! Wait for 2019 election! Select , Elect BJP &amp; MODI JI !! Bharat maataki JAI It&#39;s not his fault what he is saying .he is chanting what he has been brought on to 😐 A life of hate . I pity him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m27s\">2:27</a> He has to recall a television script to make his point. Great. That shows how shallow his knowledge is I piety these peopel who really go with what he said, it&#39;s nothing but an obstruct lie He thinks he has lot of knowledge about other religions. All false information about Quran. He should also give advice about what should government do buying oil from Muslim countries. What should those people , who are earning lively hood in cow / beef eating countries. He thinks by taking arms/law in his hands he is doing promoting nationalism. I guess what is his opinion about gifting cows to RWANDA , which is a beef eating Country. The people commenting here shows how secular India is. There should always be scholarly debate and discussion in matters related to religion, supported by historical facts from authentic sources. Human mind must be free from external control but it should be subjected to self control. Report this video as it has a misleading title. India is a <b>Union</b> if you impose your shit on us we will take some states and create our own place. And this isn&#39;t a Hindu Nationalist, upload the videos of their leaders, the politicians who call for murder and rape. <b>Fuck Hindutva</b> Utter hate<br>Disgusting man<br>Defending the killing of Muslims<br>Talking about women rights<br>This man forgot sati culture<br>This man forgot no widow re-marriage Jo dislike kiya hai suar ka aulad Hai Guys.... don&#39;t kill me ok...&quot;glad I am communist...we accept Hindus Muslims and Christians or any body else for that matter...he he he&quot; There is sever hatred for Hindus in many Muslims and Christians of India. They were converted espousing the concept that Hinduism is evil. Mark my words, if this mentality continues, is desh ka kuch nahi hoga. Unfortunately we are heading towards disaster. I hate religion.. This man is a sick mind The most liberal religion is hindu Christianity believes only one god Jesus Christ.  I am ex Hindu accepted Jesus Christ is my Lord and saviour. Father, son and the holy spirit are one called Jesus Christ. Three person but one Esssence that is Jesus Christ only.  No many gods please read holy Bible you clearly will come to know OK. What brother spoke about Christianity is totally wrong somebody misguided you try to know truth about Jesus Christ and u will blessed, may Lord Jesus Christ bless u. dude he is having wrong idea abt bible😂 and Mahabharat Late Om puri sahab ka dialogue yaad aa gaya (Nayak Se) <br><br>&quot;Acha interview tha&quot;<br><br>This guy was quite educated <br>But i appeal to him to look both the side of Coin<br><br>Sooner or Later we all have to die<br><br>No matter any religion<br><br>All say<br><br>Be good to human, Help others<br>If you will do good work<br>You will go to heaven/Swarg/jannah<br>Or else go to hell/narak/dozakh Majority in the world are Christian and Muslim so Christian and Muslim can&#39;t be wrong. The world guess you are wrong Sachi gal kahi veer ne Jay gand ji ki Jogy adityanath kutha lag that hair San Hindu randy ki aulad matorchooth Narendra Modi ki maa ki gand Who cares india sucks i totally agree with the words of this man who speaks the truth about pseudo seculars,  they are the real cancer of this  soceity,  the clear and straight views of this man is the essence of all the reasons for the unrest in indian soceity. This is the reason why we lack in development He accepted in the beginning that he belongs to RSS , so even if theres no reasons he will hate islam by his blood. Meri ek college friend hai and woh Muslim hai..  Firstly I never discriminated on the basis of religion but now I realize ki jab govt unko har cheez me assistance deti hai toh inke 5,6 bacche ban jaatey hai..  Matlab paisa hum dengey aur inke baccho ko hum khilayenge..  Had hai..  Itna kuch karney ka baad bhi yeh log humarey khilaaf boltey hai I am pro hindu  nationalist i am proud of it. meet me I will tell you what is Hindu Nationalism.. The conflicts in India have to do more with the limited resources available and less with religion or caste. India will soon replace China as the world&#39;s largest populated country. The poor are growing at a faster rate than the middle class and affluent. India can&#39;t support such a population with food, land, water, medicines, etc. Much of these things are brought in from other countries. There are not enough natural resources, employment, or shelter for such a mass. Thus, the educated Indians migrate to places like the US, Europe or the Middle East. One who graduates with a graduate degree in India is not guaranteed to obtain employment. At least in China, they have implemented policies such as one-child to curb the population crisis. When resources become limited, groups of people form these national agendas. They say things like Muslims should get less government benefits or should be expelled to Pakistan. The Sikhs, for example, wanted self-rule in the Punjab and name it Khalistan. However, if that was to happen, much of the farmlands in India would be gone. The reason why so many races, religions, and ethnic groups co-exist in the US is because there are plenty of resources, most people have a stable job and income, have a home, a car, the necessities of life, plus have some disposable money.  Thus, no one cares what their neighbor&#39;s religion is, what their dietary habits are, etc. Not only hindu but christian also hate Muslim India SE budhisit ko kisne khatam Kar Diya. Yet again people failed to understand the context of the holy quran Idle worship is forbidden 🚫 <br>In bible faith. That’s no secret <br>Stop running scared 😟 find the truth. You must hate Jews too because Torah also forbids idle worship. Absolutely correct Muslims and Christian duniya Ko tabah kar rahe hai Bilkul sahi kaha Ye sachai hai muslim ki Biggest chutiya of all timr Although The Diplomat tried to put the intention of this man into a bad light, he actually does make sense on almost all the topics. What this guy is saying is True...Secularism key naam per Hindus ka murder ho raha hai Bharat mein.... A real hindu will never think that ! <br>Hindutva is ideaology in which we culture and develop all people irrespective of religion. We develop and respect KOI EK DHARAM VISHESH NI The problem with these leftists is they dont call a spade a spade india is still a secular country not because of its constitution but because it has majority of hindu population in it being a hindu is being a I agree you, Sir If a person don&#39;t have any knowledge about Islam.. He has no rights to judge it. The video is only an opinion of a person . he didn&#39;t research on it. And he haven&#39;t a good knowledge about Islam.. At first read the holy Qur&#39;an and the hadith . then analyse and compare..  Then express your opinion... If everyone one took their own ways to deploy violence because each one feel so.. then one day you will also be in the receiving end. TRUE Nice video . Good to know their mindset . Misconcipt Bible never tells that I have nt understanded this term Hindu Nationalist! Firstly every person on this country is nationalist why do we participate in olympics to win medals for what our country. Than there exist an American Nationalists also. In India there is systematically something different bcoz of the inheritance and the colonialism, Muslims were converted from Hindu but  they don’t consider themselves as Indian first. I feel bad for this man. Poor guy has been so brainwashed that there is no hint of maliciousness in what he is saying although almost everything he said was false and only fuels hatred and violence. Indians need better education, awareness, stop being ignorant and have a pluralistic approach towards understanding different religions while at the same time having the freedom to choose their own set of beliefs. I&#39;m a nationalist Hindu too and I Proud to be a Hindu!! You guys should learn from Kerala. The Real example of unity in adversity. jab yeah pitega tab pata chalega... yeah iska baap maa bhai dada dadi iske bujurg chutiya the or hamesha rahenge..........kitna zahar leke baitha hua hai yeah BJP ka andha bhakt......sahi mein chuttiya hai jaam lagne pe bhi neta ko phone....... This guy is disgusting I wonder how such ass holes consider themselves to be religious I feel disgusted to know that people like these call themselves Indians....bloody illetrate who are they to say hatiyar uthana chaiye lathi uthana chaiye ...infact who is he to disrespect any other religion ...this guy pretends to be an Indian but looks like he doesn&#39;t know a shit about the Constitution people with such shitty minds should be kicked out of the country cheap mentality I feel sorry for the upbringing he must have given to his childrens This is a different level of sarcasm or a stupidity on another level I am going to eat beef meat today! You hindu nationalists must come to Kerala and see how Muslims Hindus Christians live in peace and harmony. This is why India will never be a developed country. Defending criminals is not the solution. Diverting the topic and saying that other religions did it too will not solve the problem. Religion is a threat to them. How old he&#39;s now<br>How he can say that<br>He&#39;s making drama 🎭<br>RSS never ever make a good citizen for our beloved country<br>RSS splitting our beloved nation<br>At the time of freedom he&#39;s not in his father&#39;s thoughts Jesus said, &quot;Love your enemies&quot; in Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=5m44s\">5:44</a>. Read Matthew 5, Matthew 6 &amp; Matthew 7. You cannot prove anything wrong with Jesus Christ whose teachings are in only 4 books (Matthew, Mark, Luke &amp; John) of the Bible. The whole Bible is not God. Only Jesus is God.  Repent &amp; turn to true God because the Kingdom of Heaven is near. please do not stereotype anybody. Muslim is first religion on earth Islam  jahil , zhoota aur dagabaj  logonka religion hai , jo dusre dharm ke logonko aadmi samaztahi nahi . Jo muslim nahi usko maro yahi Islam me sikhaya jatahai lekin jarurat padne par Muslim khud ke ma pe chadhkar bap ko salam kar sakte hai. Ma , bahen , beti , kisko bhi vo chhodte nahi aise darinde hote hai log .  Samne se unka alla aya to uspe bhi chadh baithne ka vo jarurat pade Yeh bhadwey gawaar hai kaun jiske views humare saamne rakhe jaey. Who the hell is he?? Proud hindu nationalist Sikh ko Congress madarchod ne marvaya hee Totally false nothing is written in Bible what he said . Bible teachs non violence ,mercy . Jesus Christ is living God. Jay Hind How ignorant is he to quote out of context. Did his education teach him what Vedas say about those who reject Vedas? How Buddhist    were treated in India?<br><br>He is quoting from Quran from the verses which were revealed during the time of war. Can it be justified?<br><br>Islam doesn&#39;t allow even free mixing of sexes and purdah introduced. So how can Muslims be held responsible for eve teasing? Does he know the condition of Dev Dasis and about the tradition. And why so many Hindu girls are selling their bodies? Are Muslims responsible for it? Pagal sala Insan bano sabhi.<br>Dharma aur jati k naam pe bewkoof ban na band karo Tumlog kya chinese nationalist ho. Sab bakwas bol rha.<br>Samaj me divide and rule failao.<br>Pagal banao sabko. A Hindu Nationalist is not against Patriotic Muslims\\xa0or Christians\\xa0but a Muslim/Christian\\xa0Extremist is always against us Hindus. All Muslims and Christians\\xa0who couldn&#39;t respect their Ancestral Indian Culture should Get out of India.... HAR HAR MAHADEV and\\xa0VANDE MAATARAM... Same language what kashmiri separatist says.... people can decide what they want.... can&#39;t understand this kind of hatered exist in India The guy in the above video is 100% Right !!! Nothing he said is Offensive or Racist. These are all Valid Concerns. No people in the world will want their Food, Dress, Culture and Surroundings change to adopt foreigners. Islam can be considered a &quot;Foreign Religion&quot; to India since it arrived from Saudi Arabia which is 3000 Miles away from India. I&#39;m not Racist or Islamophobia for saying this, This is the naked Historical truth, Whether you like to accept this Truth or not, That is your problem !!!<br><br>We Indians have no problem with Islam, Muslims, Islamic Holidays or Mosques in India, All this guaranteed by Freedom of Religion under Constitution and is Fundamental Basic Human Rights. But we don&#39;t want to become as Islamic as Saudi Arabia or Iran or other Islamic Nations, We are Proud of our own Culture, Food, Dress and Languages which has a relation to Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. This is what makes it India !!! Indian Muslims should stop dressing like Arabs, Stop speaking Arabic, Stop eating Food that isn&#39;t accepted by Natives in India, Stop trying to change India to suit Islam. India should remain Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh - This is our True Identity. Stop trying to modify and change our Original Identity !!! <br><br>You can have a friendly guest in your house, No problem. He can move a furniture or two in your house, no problem. But at what point will your house still remain your own house if the guest keeps re-arranging your furniture and modifying it to suit his own interests ? The Guest must also respect the fact that it is originally your house to begin with and he is allowed some degree of freedom, But not so much freedom that he tries to change and Re-Furnish the entire house, dis-regarding the Interests of the Owner of the House !!! Gau mata ke nam pe logon ko Mar Dena justified nhi h Liar <br>No one will put a condition to eat beef Itni himmat kisi me nhi h sb bhokne wale kutte h.phle insanniyt Lao andr aur desh k liye kuch kro Islam khtm kr dene se garibi aur berojgari nhi khtm hogi is desh ki What the hell is this man clearly brain washed jerks Jai hind <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a>  &quot;countries with most religious unrest&quot; . and there is <b>one particular peaceful religion</b> that would be cause for the unrest in all of them, NOT hinduism. haha ...bagooda sala What an asshole He might have Zakir naik 10 percent Indian people think like him To all people blame media politicians security forces and law in India Indian people generally nice people  BJP in power now not tomorrow good Hindus are 99% population Above All Else Just be a human being. But than again that&#39;s my point of view. The day that one human being See&#39;s the other not by his/her religion but by the fact that he/she is another human. We can hope for piece. But that&#39;s just my wishful thinking 😂 bahut sahi kaha bhai..salute Don&#39;t take it personally, I think all religions are a joke, not just yours. Never thought people were still so stupid in 21st century.  Literally everyone is living in fantasy world and spreading hatred. This is why India will never be a developed country. People keep on creating these religious propaganda and spread hatred. Bencho ne facts rattte hue hain ...pata kuch na hai isko Did they pay him to be this stupid? Good direction, but not a good selection of actor. Arey pagal ,,, tuh RSS ka kutta hai ,,,, jab se islam aaaya jab se shaanthi aaayee re pagal,,, Yea i agree with him Humaray nabi pak par aaj gusthakana khakay ban rahay pakistan mei aakar 132 bachay maar dena school mei ghus key , kisi ko nae pata yeh kowen kar raha dawood ney bilkul sae kiyaa Apnay  hathon sey pathar bana key pojtay hou itna dimagh kharab hai tumhara kabhi yeh nae socha khuda insan jaisa kaisay hosakta haii gaye insan ko pojtay hou jo khud ko nae bachaa saka mar gayaa This guy is a classic example of someone who&#39;s knowledgeable but twists information to suit his bias. He claims that harassment of women in India started after Islam, where&#39;s his evidence?. What about the Sati and Devdasi system?? What about the Mahabharata where Draupadi&#39;s clothes were taken off by Dushasana in full view of the Pandavas? Or how about Draupadi having to marry each of the Pandavas and bearing children for each of them? Would this idiot share his wife with 4 other people? Was that invented by Muslims?! Also his claim that minorities are receiving preference. I agree that the quota system can be abolished. Can he give specific examples where Muslims were given preference over Hindus in terms of jobs or education. Also regarding that there are mosques in every street in UP, what about the fact that every street in India has temples and pictures of Hindu deities. This is a secular country and people are free to practice whatever religion they want. I understand that he is frustrated with corruption and nepotism in his daily life, but to go on and blame every problem on minorities shows he lacks critical thinking. Once my country was a forward and fast moving nation. Now I have no idea where it is going but it is definitely moving backwards. May God reside in everyone&#39;s heart.

The dont know Hinduism (which is actually not the right word). Samanthan dharma has to be understood through experience. Its not a belief system. Its a way of life...it is for the seekers not believers. We search for answers and not believe in a book. <br>If you said, your belief system is the best, a true INDIAN would not quarel against it...he would simply search for the reason behind your thoughts...<br>These are idiots, and I know them Such an asshole.... <br>Mein gandhi waadi nahin hu.<br>Tumko pata bhi toh.

Aare pagal islam mein rape ki punishment death ha Islam is cancer and quran is source of this disease.<br>Cure is to get rid from Quran.<br><br>My word may be taste bitter to Muslim brothers but it&#39;s true.<br><br>If there is any God and paradise you don&#39;t have to be Muslim and believe in Quran just do good deeds that&#39;s enough for you to be in Paradise. Sahi BAAT h sahi Bol Raha h , uploader chutiya h Lol he makes more sense than a hatemonger who kills in the name of God Let&#39;s make an organisation and become united. We are weak we need to be strong. Lets fight against Islam. Jai Hind I don&#39;t know where he had read quran that allows killing of non Muslims. I had read i didn&#39;t found it anywhere in Quran. All he is telling a lie, he is just a brainwashed people like those jihadi brainwashed people. Majority of Muslims are peaceful except some groups still people believe only those who incite hate only Christianity has been in India for 2;000yrs. It is as much a fundamental part of Indian culture as it is part of any culture. Christianity is also based on Judaism, much as Buddhism is based on Hinduism. Christianity &amp; Judaism are a continuity. There have been Jews in India for 3,000yrs. We are deeply &amp; by long tradition part of the Indian nation. We have always lived peacefully amidst your people. <br><br>There are no such verses in the Bible. Christianity especially began as a small powerless sect rooted amongst groups of slaves &amp; merchants in big cities. As for when the Bible was written, the Christian Bible contains both the Old &amp; New Testament. The Old Testament was written by Jews from before Jesus was born. The New Testament was written &amp; compiled in the 1st century AD. Archeologists have recovered many fragments from the 1st century. Most of the NT text can be found amongst fragments dating to the 2nd century. It is clear the full Christian canon of scripture was known &amp; circulating in the 1st cent. &quot;LIBERALS &quot; A group of people who keep shouting that terrorism has no religion, but hindhus are extrimists. India is india becoz of tolerent hindhus who allowed all religion in here. Keep rocking The man in this video is 100%true.He didn&#39;t say any word against any religion except islam and christianity because main reason for partition and blunder of our loved nation is both religion.Self defence is the birth right of each person.I am unsubscribing this channel because this is partial and showing only one side of coin. It seems that this guy is a very great victim of the BJP IT CELL n their propaganda. I have read both Bible and the Qur&#39;an n nowhere in the Bible it&#39;s mentioned that if someone don&#39;t accept ur religion, just stone them. These kind of inter communal hate is being amplified by these right wing organizations of VHP, RSS n Bajrang Dal. Real Hindus have hatred for none. All middle eastern religion consider themselves as the best religion But yeah Islam is far worse than any other. He can personally call ministers??? 🙄 There were a few historically inaccurate statements, but most of what the man said was right, albeit from a slightly narrow perspective. Due to reservations for almost every region and caste, the general populace is robbed of the benefits that every citizen should receive, without partiality. I suggest make a video on the issue of reservation because this is a serious problem nobody addresses. When he quotes the koran and the Bible for their vile and violent teachings, The Diplomat writes apologetic statements from believers. When he quotes Hindu sources glorifying women in earlier Hindu society, The Diplomat writes &quot;unsubstantiated&quot; and &quot;scholars disagree&quot;. Bias much?! LMAO <br>You guys are sell out whores of Chrislamists. Bande ki baat me dum hai... Sahi hai bhai... Jai Sri RAM He spoke the truth against islam...Jai Hindu Rashtra... Only One question tell me what you have done for growth and development of India Hahahaha, this Indian doesn&#39;t know the Bible at all, he made up that &quot;stoning&quot; verse...no such thoughts, concepts, or verses in the Scriptures.  <br>Hindus need to stay in India and make it a better country for themselves instead of emigrating to Western &quot;Christian&quot; lands. We&#39;ll make a deal: you send us back all the Westerners living in India, and we&#39;ll send back to you all the Indians living here. Deal? What is said is 100% right great speaker.. Whatever he&#39;s saying is from his perspective.  I 100% believe as Hindu we should save our culture and our society.  But spreading hatred is not correct even politely.  Bhai koi agar galat kar raha hai toh chodo maat,  country rules ko strong karo ki galat ho hi na paye.  Par baithe baithe hatred mat failoyo desh main. You are spirutally blind...try to understand to bible...you will know sooner or later.. jesus is true .. aur bahot saal lag jayenge india ke logo ko proper education lene le liye .<br>hindu agar sach me hindu ka matlab jaan gaya to samane koi bhi ho kabhi zagada hoga nahi . sab lok apana dekhenge to <br>desh aage badhenga Very sensible.....very articulate, Hindu nationalists are very rational and knowledgeable their is no democracy in Islamic countries and freedom only to their own Muslims no other faith is tolerated. most of these countries are run by dictatorships. why is it when they come to the west and other secular countries they can practice Islamic religion freely without no objection they will try to change the law of the country to bring Islamic laws. and try to convert the people to Islam but you cannot practice your faith in their country u will be kill definite something is wrong with the people that follow the Koran. extreme May our Lord Yeshua bring light in the heart of the Muslims around the world. what the bible says if the blind lead the blind they both will fall in the ditch they cannot see pass their nose Yeshua is the light of the world He is the way truth and the life <a href=\"http://no.man/\">no.man</a> comes to the Father only through Jesus Christ Yeshua die for our sins Redemption and Salvation is only to be preached in The name Of Jesus Christ shalom Yeshua bless u all They was no Islam in India and they was no Pakistan in India india was a country by it self. the entire country belongs to india. Islam came to india u convert to Islam or u be kill it&#39;s the most violent religion in the world. the teachings of Mohammed the Koran the bible is completely different. from the Koran it&#39;s true what u said Mr Advait Religion is shit, when would this belief in an imaginary entity end in this shitty country. He is right I don&#39;t follow any religion  or any God ! ... Lmao 😂😂😂🤘 You are asking a commoner and giving statistics to falsify his opinion ?<br><br>Where is Hitler listed in the your ranking ? <br>Why were people killed during Partition? just switch the role...assume this men is indian muslim and doing same for other religions..then he has been labelled as terrorist till now......most prabably behind bars for the same....moreover we have been labelled all muslims as terrorist or brainwashed....if u can think then u can understand it...but hatoff to this guy for his truthfullness... Trueee jai shri ram Real truth and every hindu needed this behaviour Is harami ko koi ye batao is desh me SATI pratha islam nahi laya tha..ye phl se hi hum logo ki soch rhi h mahilao ko age na bhadne di jaya.. Whatever he is saying is fact and you are twisting it as unsubstantiated claims. plzz report this channel . it is strictly targetting hinduism . Half knowledge is a dangerous thing but thinking you have all the knowledge and knowing nothing is even worse. How many of the hindus read kuran and judge islam and how many of the muslims read geeta and judge hinduism. &quot;First get your facts clear , then form opinionsz&quot; If azaad kashmir is banned , if khalistan is banned. Then hindu nationalism ? India tumaharey baap ka nhi hai. This guys mind in full of hatred Chutiya OMG , Is  N.india if filled with these kind of uneducated morons. Jai Hindu Rashtra I support HIM.... based indian..hats off This man should be India&#39;s PM. I&#39;ll vote for him. He saying truth....I&#39;m not member of RSS but I appreciate help of RSS in flooded area&#39;s.....Islam is like viruse for humanity.....Now I&#39;m reading bagavth gheeta after that I read Bible n kuran....... I was studying in a Christian School. I studied the from LKG to 7th Standard.<br>They always told me that my gods were fake, there is no good made of stones and you should not worship idols. They always tried their best to make us Christians.<br>I hate them. Merkel Aap bhagyawan hai,Bhai saheb Saleh Tera RSS bohot saal national flag he nahi lagaya Tu gyaan maat deh very good brother This guy has spoken right CHUTIYA In musalmano ko gand pe laat maar ke india se bahar nikalo. The mind of an andh bakht. How can one forget How Empowered an indian Women was , thanks to The England Sati was Abolished .<br>How Hindu Womens were Sexploited , ask a women who has to Sleep with all Brothers in some Hindu tribes .<br>Hindu Women are so much so enpowered that they have to pay Dowery as againest to Islam were a Man pays dowery .<br>islam has only raised the status of Women .<br>In Islam &quot; The paradise lies benath the feet of Mother &quot; . He is right. U say india is 4 TH religion violence . India never attack on any country in history of 10k year . What is source of your data. I read about kuran fact , it&#39;s men is true . Muslim /british who kill million of Hindu /skih and India (80 %) say it&#39;s country for all . And according to u hindi is violence lover. I watch many video like this. And cry . If u not say anything your type of people take benefit of it. Banda sahi bol raha hai. I am also a Hindu nationalist. Support Modiji and bjp. Vote for bjp. He is  just normal idiot man bitch.... Can sum1 quote tht hate verse frm Bible? Ths s hw hindu nationalism grows...fake sources fake speeches The uncomfortable truth was branded as (unsubstantiated claim).<br>Do these media houses have any shame left? Gotta feel sorry for brainwashed ignoramus like these... This video is to create hinduphobia But india is not what you think.Its secularism country. Do u know why the vid says &quot;unsubstantiated claims&quot; when bible is quoted aboutt conversion &amp; then when he quotes Christian sources? And why the interviewer is also defending fellow Ibe?<br><br>Because the interviewer Vishal Arora is an Evangelical himself, his work probably is in Nepal. His wife Tehnima Arora goes to US Congress and cries Hindus are persekooting them. <br><br>This one by a supposedly secular mainstream channel &quot;The Diplomat&quot; is an evangelical trap.<br>Follow @trackevangelism and @noconversion on Twitter to know more. If Muslims or congress come into power in near future, Hindus will have to suffer and our &#39;secularists&#39; will enjoy the show There are 4.1K dislikes but not a single comment to Refute his Arguments 😂😂😂😂.<br>Fucking Anti Nationalist Coward. <b>I totally agree with him</b> The man is pretty knowledgeable, the claims that he makes are not wrong, perhaps some details are sketchy. <br><br>Freud, Professor Jan Assmann, Catherine Nixey, Jonathan Kirsch have all written on the intolerance of monotheistic faiths. Intolerance and religious hatred were born the day Moses came down from Mount Sinai after his interview with Yahweh. Pathological psycho..highly uninformed. Pathetic Proud of you bro देखो बोसडी वाला बता रहा है। चुटिया है बोसडी का Intelligent man He’s 100% right all the Abrahamic scriptures are very hostile to Pagan/Dharmic faiths to the point where they are instructed to eradicate both (they’ve been successful in Europe and the Middle East) by conversation or genocide. He just calls them by their own scriptures. Muslims are good people but <br>they are in an illusion that Islam teaches peace.... No it doesn&#39;t. 100% true Jai HinduRashtra 🚩🚩🚩🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 This guy is spot on well done Good completely agree the diplomat fuck you , and a salute to this man Christianity can&#39;t even be compared to Islam. I am a sikh and i agree with this brave man THERE IS NO CHRISTIANITY NO ISLAM SANATAN DHARMA AKA IS THE FIRST RELIGION WE TOLD THE WORLD ABOUT GOD WE TOLD THE WORLD ABOUT RELIGION. 🙏🏼🇮🇳 islam ka toh samajh me aa gya lekin bible ka kon sa page ya chapter me hai bey??? bata hmko??? I fuck ishlam Remember This Line 👉धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः - Dharmo Rakshti Rakshith : Awesome 👏🏻 ✨ People don&#39;t realize that hindus nationalism and even extremism is a direct result of 60+ years of center-left rule and minority appeasing politics. Only few hindus think like that. This is misrepresentation of hindu people. Well said man Good informative, great sir 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 Its not written in quran anywhere to trouble non muslims Russians are not fucking racist like you . He is shame to humanity Kadwa bola lekin sach bola. I totally support whatever he said . I might not agree with everything this man says, but overall what he says is true and very accurate about minority appeasement in India for political reasons and vote bank politics. Chutiyapan badjaara India me.... ⛳JAI SHREE RAM⛳ <br>⛳Jai HINDU RASTRA⛳ Har gali may Har gali may This is so true, why has India became so Muslim pleasing country.  All we learned in history class was &#39;Akbar the great&#39; and there was no mentioning of Guru Gobind Singh or Shivaji यह उनके खुद के विचार हैं सब को उनके साथ जोड़कर नहीं देखा जा सकता Bhosdi waale news channel, इसने क्या गलत बोला ये बता?? An atheist India will be superpower by 2040 Bhai ne baat to sahi kahi h... Note the sly journalism of the Diplomat - <b>liberal Muslims</b> say verses are misinterpreted (not ordinary Muslims, or just Muslims). But <b>Christians</b> (no need to say liberal Christians) say verses are misinterpreted.<br>And thus the Diplomat too subtly but surely endorses the Hindutva worldview. Hindu nationalist ....jai hind He is 100% true he know nothing about christianity he just say whatever the hell he want he says that &quot;unrest.immorality and dissent spread across the world after the birth of islam and christianity&quot; when does these religion started like he know everything hindu is just in india only bro...... गर्व है मुझे हिन्दू होने पर।🚩🕉️🚩 Sutiyaaaa Comment section is full of Hindu extremist. जै श्री राम We hindu believed that we have no right to kill some on the basis of that one doesn&#39;t believe in our gods which quran and bible does How these People can blame Islam who spent 1000 years under muslim ruled in india and still they has 80% population in indian alone. Anyhow now times under their favor but times always changes so reduce your hates since hates will burn u from inside and don&#39;t burn yourself before your last ride. And funny things is that these r the same people who working for muslims in gulf for make big money and they all feels safe there😂😂😂 ajib dogli jaat hai Nice sir.. Awesome guy.... Hinduwo ki problem Ye h ki hmare ved me likha h ki iswer nirakar h per usko janne jtane ke trike alg alg ho skte h. Jo puri trh seculer h aur isliye hm seculer h problem h islam aur crischanity se inme Ye h he nhi seculrisam inme nhi h Sahi hai yeh banda Don&#39;t hate him. Feel his emotions, his history and socitey <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m45s\">3:45</a> saudi arabia is more liberal than India according to this map. wow The highlight of the entire conversation is that HE IS NOT  INTO ATTACKING BUT DEFENDING HIMSELF AND HIS RELIGION when the time comes! Unlike actual extremists who are into forceful conversion! 4k leftist disliked great answers to be honest Jai Hind Do a Muslim nationalist video as well Well said he explained well जय श्रीराम 🚩🚩🚩 Bahut shandaar bhaiyya 🙏 100% Right. यह सेकुलरिज्म सद्भावना सिर्फ हिंदुओं के लिए है, मुस्लिम को तो सिर्फ उनके मजहब से काम है।देश उनके लिए कुछ नहीं है। हिंदू मुस्लिम भाई-भाई यह नारा किसी हिंदू ने ही दिया होगा ,आज तक किसी मुस्लिम के मुंह से नहीं यह नही सुना। Pisslam n Pisstianity. . . . <br>Both are hell bent to destroy the world very nice video I have seen so far I am proud to be a hindu nationalist best video till date I completely agree with him. I am myself Hindu Nationalist. However; I beg to differ with him on Christianity. I do agree that so many forceful conversions do happen in rural areas but I would say Christianity has evolved with time if you look at the history. Conversions can be stopped and not a problem if correct countermeasures has been taken. When it comes to Islam, I have nothing to say. Islam is not a religion of peace. I have read Quran and believe me its full of hypocrisy and violence. Islam can never live peacefully with any other religion. Those SICKular Hindus, Sikhs and all other vedic dharma people have habit to forget history. They forgot how their forefathers suffered and those who forget their history will also become history sooner or later. So wake up before its too late. Europe is gone and will perish. UK will fail. Only Asia can stand to these asshole Islamist junks. One asshole has been quoted &quot;Ahinsa Parmo Dharma&quot; to weaken vedic Dharma but the full shloka is &quot;Ahinsa Parmo Dharma; Dhrma Hinsa tathaivcha&quot;. Non-violence is the ultimate dharma. So too is violence in service of Dharma. So in order to destroy ADHARMA there is nothing wrong in violence. Mindset of a muslim - I have problem from Hinduism and Hindus Too .<br>If this Guy wants to Spread hinduism , then he would have targeted Buddhism too , but he didn&#39;t because he only wants to Show reaction on Islam and Christianity&#39;s Brutal action on other RELIGIONS . U won&#39;t find a hindu Nationalist saying kill everyone who don&#39;t follow Hinduism or Hinduism is the best Religion. Dats Dharma for u, respect everyone&#39;s beliefs Sachayi kadvi hoti hai This video is a Prime Example of Stereotyping A Section of Society. <br>I&#39;m also a Hindu Nationalist but not most of my views aligns with his thinking. Sure 9 I the most frequently quoted chapter in the quran<br>read from the first verse of chapter 9 and you will find it was said to kill politheasts of that time in kaba who was killing muslims.<br>Most of the Islamic hate videos I saw has this Sam old surah 9 stuff without any context.<br><br>Try something new To  the  Diplomat  -   You are wearing a  mask .   You are not   truthful.   You  are  doing   this with  your own  agenda .<br>Tell  us honestly and truthfully ,   about  your true agenda   and about  your true colors.  !!!!!!!!!!!!<br>What is your agenda ??????????????????????<br>If you  are not  knowledgeable,  do not want to tell   truth,  true history ,  then    if you are not   impassionate, impartial,   obviously,  you are not  qualified   to   be seen  as a  humanist  .    Take oath and  tell truth first.     I can say  with  proof   that   at present    humanity  is facing  real threat, danger, fascism  of  3    ideologies   - namely     ISLAM,   Christianity  and    communism .<br>Like Nazism,     humanity must  defeat  communism,  JIHADISM    and CRUSADERS -  these  3  antidemocratic, fascist, antisecular forces .  <br>Can you   debate with me  ?????? 10,000 likes Can you imagine they make a video with title &quot; inside the mind  of muslim extremist&quot; Druppati ko ek kafi nahi tha is liya Kon hai be yeh tota😂 I think Islam is good but those who accept islam are bad. Ye chootiye nationalist ko mar dalna chahiye. Ye saale insaan nahi hay. Good information with scientific logic explain evil Islamic Title of the video is misleading.. Sahi bol raha hai ye every time he is saying something against Islam or Muslim community then this fiberal media group diplomatically displays the caption &#39;&#39;(unsubstantiated claim)&quot;. on the top left corner of the video. not only this they have put captions regarding Muslim groups and Christian groups not claiming the verses presented by him....... what a hypocrite!! this media house got ample of time to ask those groups to substantiate the facts of other religion however when it came to checking the claim &#39;&#39;har Gali me masjid hai&#39;&#39; , they without any fact checking wrote (unsubstantiated claim). @thediplomat you should change your name to the hypocrite Well he was articulate and to the point and honest to what he knows... Christianity and Islam share many Holy Scriptures and kept on building on one another. Christianity and Islam tolerate other religion they don&#39;t respect other religions because respecting other religion implies it is legitimate for them. For them their religion is the only true religion.<br><br>The harsh condition of the desert has shaped the Abrahamic faiths. The Christian and Islamic Ethos Is built on this sense of scarcity and fear. Nature is not supportive but profoundly threatening – an enemy to be tamed, civilized and controlled. To overcome these circumstances, the desert dweller looks for relief from a God above. Desert people crave greenery so much that it is their sacred color (as in Islam). The desert dwellers need to gather more and more resources for their well being so they went on enslaving people around them .The church works upon people very hard since their childhood to impose their beliefs on them. Basically they make their people think in the ways that is in church&#39;s interest.<br><br>Christian dogmas and Greek Aristotle philosophies has had the effect of promoting exclusivism and simplistic binary categories of God/ Satan, believer/heathen, true religion/false religion , history/ myth , good/ evil,  self/other, and thus precluding any middle ground soon–leaving little room for diversity for creative growth. In every case, the first option in each pair is absolutely and exclusively valid, whereas the second option is absolutely dangerous. Not only is it negative, but it must be completely eradicated to restore order, which is not a matter of balance but of conflict and conquest. The West sees chaos as a profound threat that needs to be eradicated either by destruction or by complete assimilation.  The Western culture is less inclusive there  nobody is ok with anyone else everyone want to fix the society rather focusing on their own flaws. Nearly about 40% Europeans suffer from mental illness in 2011. We must create unity not uniformity.<br><br>Their religion starts with assumptions but does not allow any kind of questions. The pivotal assumption in their religion is that a big human is sitting above the sky in the heaven who controls everything on earth . Because they are believing things that are not in their experience and working with that which they have assumed. The moment someone give power to things that they have assumed, their mind will just fly off into all types of imagination and it will be more real than real. 99% of their religion is hallucinatory. Since those people don&#39;t know how the creation happened they made up a story from what all information they had. Since they were human beings they said a big human being is sitting up there. After All creativity is the ability to connect experiences we have and synthesize a new thing and it is not necessary that every thought or story is a manifestation of reality.<br><br>Their jealous dictator God demands unconditional obedience through his firebrand prophets and threatens to unleash His wrath or eternal damnation in hell if his strict rules of worship and conduct are not obeyed. So basically they are worshiping the authority and not someone who is having some good qualities in him . <br><br>This whole shift towards the brain and intellectual process is a European malice they gave too much significance to free thought and celebrated it because they lived under a religiously subjugated society for a long time, where you are not supposed to think anything except what&#39;s written in the holy book otherwise you&#39;re dead .It is a fact that whatever you’re deprived of becomes the highest thing in your life.<br><br>These Religions are always used as another mode of conquest as their followers have deemed superiority. They are taught by the church that they have the divine right to educate the infidel so all their actions were beyond reproach and sanctioned by the religions authorities. To go out and change indigenous civilizations to bring the light of wisdom to them. That&#39;s the reason why none of the Abrahamic religions has ever integrated with other any other culture. <br><br>The one thing standing between a pagan and their acceptance of Christ was a social structure and the manner in which communities had good relations with each other. So they introduced a hereditary hierarchy and endogamy  ( to make people cast/ class conscious  ) to create rift in society and Create people who are so ostracized from society that they themselves  would feel oppressed  and Christians inform them that all are equal under the eyes of our God if you join us there is no hierarchy. What religious Conversions actually do is putting people against each other which will lead to a civil war in future in which many lives will be lost. <br><br>In Anglo-Saxon nations no of people attending the church ceremonies has dropped by almost half. To bring them back Christians denigrate the principles of other cultures to look nicer and better from selling point. They usually criticize caste system in India and jihad in Islam and do negative branding of these religions. <br><br>All the conflict on the planet happening today people are trying to project it as good versus evil, it is not about good versus evil. It is always about one man’s belief versus another man’s belief. <br><br>Western policymakers support the destruction of Syrian because they believe in the God&#39;s promise of the Holy Land to the Jews. Holy Land is the real estate on both sides of the Jordan River which include present area of Syria and Lebanon .So the expansion of Israel is really important for the Christians. It is written in the book of revelations notes that Christ will return to holy land at the end time and then proceeding millennium will be ruled by the Christ. The sign of the end time was the gathering of all Jews in exile to the holy land of Israel in 1948. He is actually telling the truth 👏 RSS is lob Sahi bolaa bhai hindu zindabaad Plz show jihadi mindset (ohh.. jihad has nothing to do with islam) Proud to be a Hindu... What he said is experiencebeing came from Pakistan We all know Muhammad was a pedophile 🙄 He is 100% correct  mulla hatao desh bachao I tried pointing out what the man in video said objectional or extreme according to Diplomat. The man is no nonsense. What he said is utter true. The Diplomat tried to mock him or show him like a bigot, but failed miserably. <br>Even a most extreme Hindu is 100 times more tolerant than Madarsaa chhap so called Secular Muslim. Diplomat need to introspect themselves. The root cause of religious bigotry and extremism lies somewhere else, which Diplomat can&#39;t dare to dig up. <br>If you think India is secular because of Constitution of India, that&#39;s wrong. Then try to implement our Constitution to any of Muslim country like Pakistan or Saudi, they will simply throw it away in dustbin or burn it down. <br>Hindus are Law abiding people to the core, that&#39;s why they are obeying this constitution.<br>Remember, India is secular only because of Hindus. Show me a single Muslim country where secularism prevails or minorities are safe enjoying basic rights. The moment Muslims in India becomes Majority, India will be renamed as Mughalistan, a 57th Muslim country. So, dear Diplomat don&#39;t be an ostrich. And STOP demonizing already secular and peaceful Hindus. <br>- A Hindu Nationalist Bhartiya that&#39;s a truly negative mind that&#39;s why muslims are not happy in india total bulshit and worst thinking about religion he is talking  about islam and before islam did you know the first human being were ADAM PBUH he was a prophet of ALLAH and than humans began islam were their. He is our hero we love you sir. Bilkul Sahi Kaha 100% True.<br>Muslims in India should be allowed to stay only at one condition: Convert to Hindu.  If not, then go to Pakistan / Afghanistan.<br>Let be Peace in India.  Hindustan Belongs to Hindus.  Hindusthan = Hinduon ka Sthan hai! From where this type of highly uneducated people come? I am also a HINDU NATIONALIST and I support SECULAR INDIA... well read and said... an average hindu Indian man... good brother, i agree with you. Double like for this vedio Bhai....insaan ko insaan maano...or kich nhi... All the rape in india today is islams fault. That is what he is saying. What a stupid idiot.. and angry mindless people will support his nonsense. Well said man 👍 Very good thought brother GARV HAI RSS PE...HINDUISM PE MODI G PE... Jab Tak tum jaise chutiye is desh me hai we will always be a third world country. The reason of this situation is only Congress who have ruined the country and have neglected the majority in last 70 years. Now the world has gone to the dogs because of people have no other option. told the reality despite his challenging backgrounds and humble  beginings he articulated  the things in much better and frank candid way Are  kabhi ye Muslim ka bhi dekha no ye toh pura Taliban bana kar ready attack karne ki liye Hindu ko toh ek Mandir nhi ban rha h मै आपकी बात से बिल्कुल सहमत हू👍👍👍👍👍 Where is rubbish kumar, khaniya , jnu, ppv.... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECJqr3HN6_Q\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECJqr3HN6_Q</a> I am reporting this as Misleading from such a well known institution in journalism,<br>The title, shud be &quot;The Heart of a Nationalist by Agenda Driven Journalist&quot; Wake up Hindus!. What he says about Abrahamic religions is completely true. Christianity used to do in the dark ages what Islam is doing today and according to them no one who does not adhere to their religious tenets can attain salvation. The rise of Hindu nationalists in the country is solely a reaction to the propaganda of Islam and Christian missionaries against Hinduism. If we were to remove this poking, Hindus will themselves return to their egalitarian nature. There is a reason why even tiny minorities like Jews and Parsis have always felt safe in India There&#39;s nothing wrong in what he said. Try spreading diversity in pakistan ;) Hindus have suffered all throughout history. There&#39;s going to be more pakistans inside India. Nothing wrong in protecting ourselves when all everyone ever wants to do is destroy us Before Christianity and Islam also, women were tortured in India by the Hindu culture through stupid customs of Sati and Child Marriage, and many others. Also, most discriminatory practice within Hindu people was and still is the Caste System. This RSS idiot has nothing to say about these glorious customs of his religion but will blame and point finger on other religions. This shows the typical mentality of this guy and his stupid organization, to which he belongs. Typical RSS illiterate. All the idealogies that this idiot has mentioned about Christianity are RSS fabricated fake theories. I belong to Christian community in Kerala that has its detailed history since 1st century A.D. During 1st century, Christianity was a persecuted religion by the Roman rulers and hadn&#39;t reached Europe itself and was only confined to some middle east countries and just reached Kerala.  If Christians were intolerant, then many Hindus wouldn&#39;t have become richie richs in Christian majority European and American countries. That&#39;s wrong on BJP part it should listen to all not just supporters or on personal level opiums Modi ji Nahi rahenge aur chanakya me Kaha hain ki ek Sant ko raja Nahi banana Chahiye <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rnEtkh9KxM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rnEtkh9KxM</a> We live free without fear  ... Can you please ask same thing to Muslims if you have a dare Respect His idea of Secularism is based on how because a certain religious minority i.e Sikhs or Kashmiri Pandits faced problems, so should the Muslims face now, which is definitely not what the Indian constitution preaches. It is also surprising to note how delusion fuelled with a political majority, can make people actually justify and support their violent acts. I would spare Christianity they have done cruel things but there is huge positive part in that religion too Islam is just all violence Bol do caste system , johar , untouchability , dowry ... Yeh sab bhi muslims and christians hi laye the... Itna bhi Hinduism great nahi h , Jitna nationalist samaj te h Idk about Muslims but the Guys just attacking Christians on something he heard on TV wtf? U r  totally about wrong ,do u know islam means peace The difference between Right winger Hindus and Islamists/leftists is that Hindus want only equality nothing more, nothing less whereas Islamists/leftists want supremacy. Truely said Manu smriti  ke bare main bhi bol bhai Jai Hind. Unexpected words from a Hindu nationalist. But I see genuine reasons in his speech. There is pseudo secularism across the country and it shud be stopped. We cannot give our countries future to the corrupt politicians.. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23proud2behindu\">#proud2behindu</a> Defaming hindu people’s <br>Its just a bjp supporter not a hindu definer<br>Grow up<br>Our thoughts are way open than this guy Islam Mai Aur Quran Mai kahin Nahi likha ke Kafir ka qatal karo,  ek begunah ko Marna poori insaniyat ko Marne ke barabar hai....

Unbiased  truth and the clarity that the hindu spirituality and nationalism is at their respected positions, which seems somewhat confused by the muslim community <br>2.speaks of defense violence <br>3. mutual respect at its fullest ( listen to a quran fanatic if you wanna know mutual respect and tolerence)<br>4.attempts of clouding the philosophies through negative portrayal  like this  THE DIPLOMAT does hindu most secular in world...... U make me cry!! Uncle The says nothing in context to what he said which is why who couldn&#39;t give us book chapter and verse Pls I request you to do same on other religions. Chutya... <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jhGnglI4Ktg\">https://youtu.be/jhGnglI4Ktg</a> &#39;Make the lie big, keep it simple, keep saying it and eventually they will believe it&#39; is quote from Nazi propaganda chief Dr Joseph Goebbels. dont spread hatred.this man is totally brainwashed by rss.killing the nonbelievers quote from Quran is about a group of people. they declared war against prophet pleas check this link.t<a href=\"https://youtu.be/UiTSydIqNdA\">https://youtu.be/UiTSydIqNdA</a> Gandhiji ke hatyare ne khud ko Abdul Salam kyu bataya..??

Who is this the diplomat.. ha ha ha seems to be obsessed with Hinduism.. Bht  badhiya kaha ...i hope bht se log k sun k phat gai hogi Well said my brother.. Om Namah Shivay... Akdin pura dunia Muslim hoga yead rakho So let me get this straight... This man&#39;s family had to leave their everything coz some allahu akbars compelled them to do so. Now you expect him to read namaz or what😂... But talking about christians doesn&#39;t make any sense though What if i tell u he&#39;s right.... The thing is you guys can easily question this kind peoples just go to somalia or any other pigistan and just dare to question their belief and see the consequences you shitty people would be facing...what diplomat kind of channel is this?? Hello! history is been distorted the research is still going on by the way most of the historians are westerners... Ek ar aise chutiye agar aa gye to desh may hamesha hindu muslim hoga koi chapter may hindu ke baare may kch n likha h bhai log ye admi bht bada wala chu h muslim version of Hindu. 100 % muslim in this category ,Hindus little bit less. Religious violence ki wajah bhi batane ke dam rakho. Kayar saale appeasers He speaks as if he knows everything about Christianity and Islam. And everyone here in comment section believing him. What&#39;s his qualifications to judge religions. Is he a student of comparative religions...? All he was said, what he was taught. He is a political person, he was trained for that and brain washing people in name of Barat matah. These people create miscreants in society. In India, people who hates only Pakistan and Islam, considered a Patriot. Whatever he said is 100% correct Religion is the root of all evil. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism or something else. It&#39;s all trash. It truly boggles my mind that we human beings, who symbolize the pinnacle of evolution,  can still be so incredibly stupid and gullible, as to believe the noxious fairtytales that (all) religions feed us with, and use those fairytales to wage wars with each other and spread hatred and unrest. Wake up, people!! Om Actually I&#39;m amazed by his clarity of thought. Think rationally,, he is actually making sense with his words. The guy did pretty well for an average bloke... Just another cain and abel story. Muslims and hindus will be brothers but no one knows who will backstab them and who will behave. Just know god is watching. Karma exists. Your hell exists. RSS British ka chamcha ..... hindustan ka dusman Aba chutiya masjid Tera bap Chanda lakar nahi banta .... Masjid musalmano ki apni paisasa bantahai ......       No government never help any masjid in hole Indian history but government make millions Hindu temple by the taxes of indian Muslims .....or sun shik vhioko hinduona maratha bhuk Gaya khalitan issue ..... Terrorism start by this durty mind .. Pure lies kiuki abivhi millions Hindu Pakistan may rahahai .... Or ooo pure Hindu hai What he said is 70% true . i believe in it but some statements are totally false. Why should we say Allah hu Akbar, why should we eat beef against our wish. This happened at the time of partition and happened again in Kashmir when Kashmiri Pandits were driven out. <br>It will happen again wherever this death cult rules roost. Bengal and Kerala maybe next. <br>Why should Hindus tolerate subjugation and how long? He is right. Only muslims not christianity Agree with this guy. brother u want to show something else but people are believe something else i personally hate racism &amp; casteism so i don&#39;t believe it  <br>although nice vid helped me to understand how people think about other religions<br>&amp; i really dont mean to upset anyone so dont go crazy on comment section 😔 Bhai ne wo Quran ka verse bola hai wo Quran 9:5 hai Islam is a religion of peace and the Quran is a book of peace<br><br>Humanity is but a single Brotherhood. So make peace with your brethren. (Quran 49:10)<br><br>Surah Taubah Verse Number 4 <br>4. Except those idolaters with whom you made an agreement, who then did not show any latitude (in executing the treaty) and who did not support (or reinforce) anyone against you. So fulfil the (peace) treaty with them till the end of the term. Surely, Allah loves those who fear Him. <br><br>This person is ill informed. The verses of surah taubah speak about the times when  Holy Prophet Muhammed S.A.S declared his prophethood and starting speading islam and the belief in one god. There was a huge plot to kill him and kill all the people who accepted islam.  After this there was peace treaty signed between the followers of Islam and the polytheists . The Polytheists  then broke the treaty and starting killing muslims again. Then Allah asked the muslims to fight back and defend themselves against only those people who are waging war against the muslims. It specifically mentioned not to hurt the polytheists who are not hurting the muslims and accepted the treaty of peace. Humanity is but a single Brotherhood. So make peace with your brethren. (Quran <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=49m10s\">49:10</a>) Extraordinary thought. He said he oppose Islam not Muslims. Some people are just creating complexity to gain their own interests. dropdi was attempted to be raped <br>wat the shit he is talking about <br>all the history  of India  is about women and dalit <br>it is true he is really pakistani <br>new in India Bahut  thik   sir Hindu Rastra Chahiye!!! Bahut sahi. I don&#39;t get why people declare events of history or the scriptures of a particular religion.without even a proper discussion. I certainly understand what the man may have gone through and his views, but some of his justifications don&#39;t really make sense. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m23s\">2:23</a> aisa kahi bhi bible mai nahi likha gaya hai baghwaan sabke hothe sirf isayo ke nahi hai<br> kyu galat prijudice kar rahe aap pure bible ya quraan padho phir batao <br>bhai aap achhe insaan hai par apko galat sikhaya gaya hai negative prejudice about other faiths <br>dusre dharm ke baare galat sikhaya gaya hai tumhe<br>kaash isse achha ki tumhe bachpan me  insaaniyat sikhaya hotha tho tu aaj ek sachha Bharatiya hota<br>bhagwaan tumhari hifasat kare 🙏 Good Please try to be humans.<br>U kill a human because of he is from another religion then it&#39;s a crime.<br>Save humanity and don&#39;t divide urself by religion.<br>Religion is a practice/prayer to the god.<br>Don&#39;t disobey human ethics in the name of religion.<br>Please don&#39;t kill animals for food.<br>May it be beef,pork or lamb don&#39;t eat them.<br>This is 2018,don&#39;t make religion as a weapon to develop a nation.<br>Remember how British tore our independence movement just by spreading a religious riot.<br>That riots divided india and Pakistan.<br>If we use religion as a weapon then outsiders will use it as our weakness.<br>Make the constitutional law strong, support army and police forces for good work.<br>Give good wages to policemen.<br>Stop mob lynching.<br>These r the things that will keep our country strong.<br>And finally be democratic.<br>If ppl demand for good things then good things will happen. Abe gadhe wo jo chapter 9 me kafir ko obstruct karne ke liya likha hua hai vo makka wale logo ne jab bahut zulm kiya tha to un log ke khilaf jang karne ke bare me hai. Bhai pandavo ne apni biwi ko bech Diya tha jue m .. Islam aane se phle...

Or ye dono religion duniya ke sabse bde religion h ........ He is right I love hindu nationalist. they are absolutely correct.... Garv se kaho hum hindu hai...!!! Sir, my grand parents were Hindu, however I am born catholic and from childhood I go to church and I have never heard of this verse of throwing stone on non Christian. Even if I believe you that there is a verse did you see any Christian throwing stone at any non Christian. And if you find such a offensive verse in bible can&#39;t you reach out to any bishop or cardinals to correct it ?? Why to spread hatred among people. I am die hard fan of modi but trust me even modi won&#39;t support such ideology of hatred hez high on weed🤣🤣🌚🤣 Koi bhi Dharm violence spread nahi karta . Agar itna BJP ka support hai toh 4 saal mei Ram Mandir nahi bana pae. UP mei yogi and centre mei modi .  Agar Ram Mandir ban gya toh muda khatam . Yeh log bas Dharm ke Naam par Raaj karte hai bas He is completely right. Kisi ne sahi kaha tha<br>Jaisi sangat mein paloge waise hi banoge<br>Aaj dekh bhi liya!<br>No hate comments please, thank you, I respect everyone because my religion ALHAMDULILLAH doesn&#39;t teach me to disrespect anyone by any means! :) these people are brainwashed to hate Islam and christianity.. Sahi bole hai His views are correct Pissslaaamm Abe chutiye chup jis k bhagwano k kaam krida se ved ramayan manusmurti bhari padi ho wo dusre dharam pe ungli utha raha hai <br>according to the Vedas manusmurti beef eating is permissioble in hindu religion. pahle sanatan dharam ka koi tyohar go mans khaae bina poora nahi hota tha. aor waise bhi gow rakshak naksali ye sab se bada atankwadi sanghtan hai RSS ne aor us k atankwadi sanghtan  desh me atank machaya huva hai over doz of gow mutr But jeher bhara h.. Can you please do a video on pages in Quran and verify weather this person is right on his views. Islam Aane k Bad he Satti Km hui hai India Mae. Fatima Al Fihri (A muslim woman) was the women who opened the first ever university.<br>Where is he getting his knowledge from? जय श्री राम । Dislikes show that truth is bitter and we know mostly who disliked are our very own &quot;Muslims&quot; who get funding from Saudi and Pakistan to spread &quot;Islam&quot; or &quot;Terrorism&quot; (both are synonymous terms) har dharm me kuch kami hai but ye samjhna chhod k dusro          par blame lagana jyada aasan hai.<br>itna hi fikar hai to in kamiyon ko dur karo.<br>aapke logic k hisaab se to dalito ko bhi weapon utha lene chahiye So they are also like Taliban without aks? This is the way we think about our Assamese Religion against the govt who is trying to bring Hindu Bangladeshis in our State.<br><br>We donot want Hindu or Muslim Bangladeshis.....Because we are Assamese.<br>We eat Beef,Pork, chicken etc.<br>We are not Traditionally Backward people.<br><br>That is what makes Assam along with the other NorthEast States different from other states.<br>We didnot have any Religious violences among our people ie Assamese People. If a Hindu likes his religion! He is bad? Really! Guys please don&#39;t forget to watch FMF videos! what he said is 100% true Fake man, he is speaking what he is told to speak so Hinduism is not a religion , its the way of living...unlike any other religion in the world. Hinduism is named as a religion by the west , as they were amazed as India didn&#39;t have any religion when they came in, they were living and praying , and not praying to any god at all.. and did not suffer any consequence at all .. then they knew that it was their way of living, what they followed had nothing written about worshiping of god and if not suffering ... all the religion in the world says &quot; if you don&#39;t worship god , god will punish you&quot; (as if god is a terrorist) , Hinduism says , do what you do , if you are a writer , write books , the book is the god for you , if you are a ruler , rule the country well, ruling is the god for you . your karma is your god . if you are a sculpture , make statues, the statue is your god.If you are a scientist , discover and invent , those are your god. The western civilization could never accept this and they wanted to abolish the system...so they gave the way of living a name ...Hinduism and called it a religion. so that they could convert the people. You know why? If going by Hinduism , anyone on the earth can be a Hindu in an instant ... he just did not have to baptize or do any such thing that other religion does ... he has to do one simple thing ... DO his duty. A writer simply needs to write , a ruler simply needs to rule , a teacher simply needs to teach if you do that , then you are a Hindu . And the west simply hated that ,... now that would simply mean all the person in the earth would be a Hindu and are a Hindu ... they could never accept it. The next was to manipulate this ideology , the easiest thing to do was to give the ideology a name and call it a religion......thus Hinduism. Try to read puranam, vedha , upanishath , along with bible, kuran ... then understand whats written there . Dont just read anything with a preset mind. You will truly appreciate INDIA. How open we really are , how acceptable we were , and how all those simply vanished the moment other religion came to India . we tolerated all other religion , because , Hinduism is not a religion, and will never be a religion. To aap bhi gita mein amendment kar ke logon ko maar na chalu kardo bhagwaan aap ko sadbudhhi de. Its not liberal muslims but all muslims have a view that this ayat does not encourage to kill non muslims..the fact is during the time the ayats were revealed the muslims at the time had a treaty with the non muslims which they had broken and were preparing to fight muslims.. hence in surah tauba its stated that kill non muslims and in verses ahead was also told to not fight with non muslims who do not want to fight and also calls upon muslims to secure lives of non muslims who are unwilling to fight. THIS IS REAL Jai Shri ram He is super ugly 😂😂 Motherchod Christian is good...<br>I&#39;m a Proud Hindu The best religion in the world is Sikhism. I am a Hindu but I love the philosophy of Shikhs. You are wrong about Christianity. No where in the bible that instructs to kill non believer. Have you heard of any Christian suicide bombing? Very right views He is very much aware of himself, his past and his country. Keep it up. yes he is right. India has been suffering from islamic extremism from a long time. Christianity and Islam are destroying our Nation Mahabharat me adharm kaise aaya aur what about dropatis cheer haran koi to reply dedo 100% agree Kitna terrorism bhara pada hai is chutiye mein . Aur kaise dimag se khel kr apni baat sach dikha raha hai . Niche comments mein janta ka fuddu ban raha hai and yeh sab bacche log yakeen bhi maan gye iski baat ka he is exactly right . This s the prblm with hindu nationalist they have fake sources... fake sources brain washed Such a well articulated explanation....compare this to an Islamist who will simply try to impose his supremacy over others.<br>If at all The Diplomat tried to portray this guy in negative light (blame pseudo secularism)....alas, they failed miserably :-) title is &quot;the hindu nationalists&quot; and sample is one person. does he alone hindu or spoke person of hindu socity or are you anti hindu ? pls confirm Okay, the person shown here in this videos is claiming a lots of things without proof. But how could a person carry all the literature at the same time? And the interviewers are at fault too. The 5 marriages of draupadi part was also highlighted as unsubstantiated claim but it&#39;s a fact written in mahabharata. The interviewers are clearly seen as biased in the video. and i openly hate muslims for being hypocrites and most religious on earth at the same time they preach to lessons about being scularism proud to be hindu nationalist if you guys have problem just scan the mind of average muslim person im damn thousand percent sure he is more extremist than even hindu extremist! i have never seen any muslim nationalist? why there is only hindu nationalist on this earth? or is it khangress , and mullah propaganda btw nice acting by guy. Great guy. Jay hindutva Dislike for the title not the man. <br>He said what he felt.<br>Dislike for thia channel All Hindus Think like this ! This is for the friends from the West...Imagine that you are one of those people, who were affected by the actions of &quot;Newcastle grooming gang&quot;, or who lived in the area that were affected by the activities of these gang members. Now imagine if similar things happen 100 times across a few generations. Then a person comes along. This person has read about your culture only on google. Now, if that person tells you that you are Islamophobic, How would you react to that?<br>The fact that the acts of such gangs find sanction in religious books is bad enough. Calling that faith as &quot;Religion of Peace&quot; is unscientific and so anti-Freedom!! Something logical What about &quot;mind of islamic fundamentalism&quot; बिल्कुल सही कहा है मेरे हिंदू भाई ने कोई शक मुल्लो को है तो अल्लाह से पुछो जिसका नाम का अर्थ ये निकलता है की आतंकवाद,लव्ह जिहाद धर्म भेद Bhai Hindu nahi hea yes, sanghi hea Agar isne kurran para hota to  yea khudh islam Kabul karta , ,jub bjp kea chele hea to hate speech hee bolega,bhakt Jo hea who the hell is this ananya bhattacharya and how can one address their own country as &quot;Worst&quot; everything rest is okay people have their views where are these types of editors and journalists when muslim extremists say something like this or do any act of violence(Dhulagarh riots)? And I don&#39;t have problem with either of them if they want to show that hindu are extremist then let that be, world has many more countries with less or no hindus still terror attacks are done there and syria is a very good example of that, but how dare this editor address our country as being worst in his/her article? this surely isn&#39;t an internation article or would have to pay for it if other countries would have clue about addressing them as worst. This is India you can write or do anything against this country and nothing bad will happen to you that&#39;s a sad part of our democracy. Ek Muslim ki jaan 10 Hindu se Jada kimati hai That guy has a point Jai Hind jai Hindutva 🕉️🕉️ bhai Sri kisrsan ji ne kya kiya raslila and bhagwan shiv k nam pe bhag pi k log ladkiyo k gandi harkt krte h yesb kiska dhrm jayz h sabhi dhrm burai hoti h I am truly impressed with this person&#39;s knowledge. This is what Muslims do to any country where they travel. Seriously, you are showing a statistical data about social hostilities and there is no name of Saudi Arabia. What kind of liberal bubble are you living in? He is spot on about Quran but very wrong on the Bible. What he was talking about was in old testament. Just to let everyone know, I am an Atheist, born in Hindu family. I am an Atheist Nationalist, born in a Hindu family. I don&#39;t think everyone should be painted with the same brush as suggested by the title. Sab bhatkewe log hai kisi me insaniyat bachi nahi sharam ana chahiye log ko jo sochty hai ki iska religion ghalat uska religion alag sabne sabse pehle insaniyat ki sochna chahiye Hi guys,between all this hate of Hindus and Muslims,here I am (a Hindu) I have a Rakhi sister(a Muslim) and she supports me more than anything else in the world,I don&#39;t have any knowledge of Ramayana and Quran and whatever god you may talk about,I live in the present,she is life to me and that counts,revenge or hate never brings happiness,na Allah ne tumko darshan diye Hein na hi Ram ne,to phir kaiku Jagad rahe ho,pyaar deke dekho,pyaar milega,Allah Hafiz,jai shri ram❤️ This guy was spot on! This so called &quot;dehati&quot; and &quot;desi&quot; guy made more sense than any of the arguments these leftists pseudo intellectuals keep coming up with. I think hindu have to follow the geeta and not to have this type of mentality..yeh dikhata h politic&#39;s se dharm ko kaise joda jata h hindu ho geeta pado,upnishad pado Beta islam main ladkiyan hamare lye qimti hoti hai isi lye unko hum loog parde main rakhte hai qimti cheez ko sab gandah hone nahi dete agar yahi tumhare demaag main hai ke hum apni ladkiyon ko azadi nahi dete hai to theek hai agar hamari ladki ke lye ye azadi nahi hai to wahi sahi tum kon hote ho bolne wale tumhe to apni man behan qimti nahi hai iska matlab hame bhi hamari man behan qimti nahi hai. Sala dropdi ke sath jo 5 bhai milkar suhag raat manaya wo theek tha agar aisa hi hai tumhara mentality to mera ek sawal hai tumse.. Ke kya agar tumhari behan shadi karke jati or uski saas bolti bhai ko ke beta tum loog jo lekar aye ho sab milkar bant lo phir 5 bhai ek ek karke suhag raat manate to phir tumko kaisa lagta or tum kya karte I was like a normal Indian but now I am atheist Guthka toh thuk le🤣🤣🤣🤣 Proud on you guy... appeasement of looters&#39;s offsprings should be stopped. islam is nt a reliegon of peace 🙂 क्या हिन्दू लड़कियों को दबाया जा रहा है? ?  <br>जब द्रोपती 5 शादी कर सकती है तो बाकि हिन्दू लड़कियों को एक शादी के लिए बाध्य क्यों??<br><br>जब हिन्दू साधुओं को नंगा घूमने का अधिकार है तो हिन्दू  लड़कियों  को साडी पहने के लिए विवश क्यों किया जाता है?? Agreed man<br>Jai Shri ram 🚩 why is the video name Hindu nationalist? I am an atheist, I honestly do not support him but i am little angry by the fact that some gullible fool is called a nationalist(according to you). if you consider south India and Northeast India nationalist is a title given to people doing more respectful <a href=\"http://work.so/\">work.so</a> go f yourself assholes The meaning of this video just flew over people&#39;s heads. Ask this guy doesn&#39;t have sources to what he says about Christianity and Sikhism Yeh hindu nationalist nahi hain fake hain don&#39;t believe in the tag line Hahahahaha! To The Diplomat guys, can you at least pretend to be not biased? Or none of you has thus far managed to come out of your coccons? What the hell with Indian Christian like me ? We nev backed down saying Jai Hind, we are most educated people in India, there&#39;s no anti Christian activities in Bible , no violence at all like it is in Quran. We nev did terrorists attack just to make our Christ happy, why would someone blame Christian for not having Peace? Do you Hindus really believe we Christians are the reason that India is unstable? We love the country more than anyone and we are serving in all sectors, hopefully people see real threat is Islamic state. Jai Hind. <b>Scratches Head, wonders what this has to do with anything. (Unsubstantiated Statement)</b> This guy has lack of knowledge about Islam and Christianity as well. Bible was not written by Constantine, 40 people written Bible who were believed to be blessed. And nowhere is written in Quran that kill non believers. This guy is totally uneducated and stupid May god guide you. I m too a hindu nationalist ... And listen this guy is great ...and he is correct ...i have been disturbed by Muslims since childhood ...my family was withdrawn from our land ....bcz of Muslims true though A profound example of illiteracy Why you pseudo-liberals and pseudo-secularist don&#39;t do an interview with Muslim extremist?? And when he could not give the proper references you were showing on the top that &quot;unsubstantiated comment&quot; or something like that then why doesn&#39;t you showed the same thing when you guys made some comment about the matriarchal society of Mahabharat because there also you have not given any proper references why just why? shame on you, you hypocrite pseudo-liberal. Sick minded... ksye lgou ko interview karate hou...?? He is totally anti muslims and anti Christians... Idot This person is proving that hip is biased whereas indian ideology gives equal right to every religion What he has spoken is almost the truth of indian society. Hindus are being instigated by the followers of islam and christianity on a daily basis. What else do you expect in return? Video in video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m16s\">2:16</a> &quot;he told if your real brother doesn&#39;t believe in Christianity then stone him to death&quot;. Bhai in which bible that is been written. Please don&#39;t spread the wrong news. It&#39;s might be your understanding. He&#39;s actually stating some true facts, not all true but being an extremist he is not open to some other worldly things. I love hindustan i love hindusim too and i said it bravely does that dude know he&#39;s being recorded? 😂😂 Hardly 80 saal ki life hain , usmei bhi  Religion- Religion khelna hain ? ya Milke humanity ke liye kuch acha Contribute karna hain ?

Tum jaldi se mar jao....sale harami assam ki bahar isiliye thik ho...sale pakistani .... he is speaking the truth. <br>what about 1984riots he is 100% right Modi ji jab dusre countries visit karte hain, inn bhaisab ko bhi please leke jayega taki thodi duniya dekh sake. Kafir means  disbelieve....and he is talking  about  surah  taubah well he didn&#39;t  mention  the context...the context  is a pledge  was assigned  between  the Muslims  and disbelievers  of non violence  but the disbelievers  of Makkah  broke  the pledge then Allah  s.w.t  commanded  muslims  to fight and  only  fight  to those  who opposed  and broke  the pledge ....and even after that  verse Allah  s.w.t  says if  some who don&#39;t  want to fight  with and wants peace  let him go in even a safe place........u must not  chose verse from here and there  rather  with specific  context.....thank u Please do an interview like this in Pakistan / Syria / Saudi Arabia. Wish to know the mind of an Islamist He is RIGHT and CORRECT Idiot.Degrading the name of Hindus .I know many Hindu people and non of them think on this <a href=\"http://line.no/\">line.No</a> religion in the world propogates <a href=\"http://violence.it/\">violence.It</a> is the people who are evil not the religion.castism,dowry,self immolation, untouchability,child marriage,and many more is propogated by Hindus and not Hinduism .Understood,and don&#39;t misinterprete the verses of any holy book without knowing what comes after and before that Population of hindus in Pakistan droped from 15% to 1% in last 70 years and in Bangladesh from 18% to 8%.Hindus will be minority in 2061 in undivided India. How many Hindus in Pakistan and how many Muslims in India are there, is the truth, all this is sham propaganda. If this train of thought exists also, it is just a thought but Pakistan is the reality, and how it has been ethnically cleansed of Hindus. There is no comparison in numbers. All the people who support him are foolish as him why dont all live in harmony but i wish everyone can know that jesus christ is the real lord amen Before commenting about the  innocence of Hindus, watch this..how they planned and killed the Muslims <br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0E0i_IeKyIo\">https://youtu.be/0E0i_IeKyIo</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ye5TKNKksR0\">https://youtu.be/Ye5TKNKksR0</a><br>World first university was established by Muslim women and people still thought that there is not any place for women education in islam He is saying true Jay hind 😎 Just show the real hidden face of a hypocrite Muslim  and his filthy views on Humanity. 😂😂 Maja aaya bhaiyaa When Muslims and Christianity teachings are saying that if someone is not accepting a religion tell that person and make others to believe animal Islamic and Christianity belief did Hindu or hindutva teach anyone that kill anyone who is not accepting the input or Hinduism there is no fair in 2 teachings is being teach that kill other person to accept that into twice great and that is the reason in that even today it is great always it will be great and coming to the part of the conversation on the video he was from Pakistan and he was telling about Pakistan and other countries he did not mentioned Indians are Indian Muslims or Indian Islamia NSE or Indian Christian ians and coming to the part of Hindus or hindutva I just tell one word of sentence on one letter of sentence that is till now India has not attacked any country till date that is just because of hindutva rules and regulations big Pakistan do this did China do this do you know what Pakistan did the concurrent Kargil because of them Kargil war was started and who stays in Pakistan that is Islamic people now I am sir answer all your shit shit things how are you Sch h ye muslims  kisi b non muslims desh k sge ni huye ....maymamr jaise desh jo k shanti k liye jane jate h vo ye na krte...or iska nuksan assam walon ko bhugtna pd rha h Well this happens when good old religion is altered to extremism by idiots...for that you cannot blame every HINDU.I hope you understand ☺ Do a video on Islamic or abrahamic fundamentalism<br><br>Let&#39;s be secular about it let&#39;s listen to their point of view RSS is equal to ISIS....Both of their agenda is same...The only difference between them is one is Hindu and the other is muslim Fanatic , ignorant &amp; narrow minded person Ek dam sahi kaha bhai RSS is the correct organisation Muslims should leave  the country and Congress ka vajaha SA he Muslims ke population increase hue ha Na koi religion hota na koi problem hoti. Putin is anti muslim 😅😅😅 <br>Seriously he is saying the truth Kafiro ko maro aisa Kya sahi m kehta h Quran aur Bible?? This kind of channels can only demoralize the Hinduism. they have not enough courage to show the true essence of Islam. Because they have to present to the world the outlook of being a secular channel. It&#39;s a shameful phenomenon Samajh naheen ata keh India main koi khulla sarak main kharray ho keh kisi religion say dushmani declare kaisay kar sakta hai. Pakistan main yeh ho na tou aik dou jhaapparh zarror lagain gay keh bhai pagal wagal ho kia 😂😂 wow india you are truly an intolerant nation. 3.5k are pseduo secularists 😂 Savarkar ji..Khushi dekho RSS wale bhai ki. You aren&#39;t fighting for your religion buddy.. you are fighting for your napunsak pm for his political milage..<br>In short moral chod diya hai tumhara RSS ideology ne. Man of small knowledge part of a wonderful religion with wisdom, age and knowledge. The Irony is that Ignorance exists in all 3 religions he mentioned; he definitely proved it... Abey ye title defame karne dala hai Hindus ko That same Draupadi he&#39;s talking about was publically shamed and almost disrobed in front of the whole court. Not taking anyone&#39;s side, just stating. Get you facts straight, that&#39;s all. Hinduism is open to reform, Islam is not. The verses in the Quran do encourage violence against non believer which are used by radical Islamists to wage war against civilisations. It&#39;s not Muslims that people and cultures all around the world are opposed to. It&#39;s the radical ideas of Islam. F**k muslim thoughts I feel sorry for him😿😿😿 Im Hindu and proud to be Jai Shri Ram Yeh Banda sahi bol Raha hai I didn&#39;t expect that he being a normal and average hindu, got the knowledge of hate against other religions in quran and bible. I think only people that need to get this information are secular bolloywood stars, intellectuals, liberals, communists, jnu students, ndtv anchors. Title of the video is very disguisting ! <br>&quot;The man speaking&quot; seems very interesting ...<br><br>ISLAM = TERROR    And so as chritianity .<br># Jai hind Bhai trump aur putin ke bare bola hai Modi kyon jeeta woh bhi boldo the amount of Hinduphobia is evident Why alway Hindus been targeted? Why interviews of Muslim fundamentalist not been interviewed What was the religion of prophet mohammad before he invented islam??? Jai Hindu Ekta. Ram Ram bhaiyo So what do you wanna prove??<br>Are you interested in proving that India is intolerant or Hindus as intolerant just bare in mind that in China Google is banned forget their tolerance to other religions apart from whatevers in their country<br>So you are able to publish this content so freely because of tolerance of Indians and Hindus just bare in mind that Hinduism existed for more than 3.5 k years and your most &quot;lovely&quot; Christianity came just some 2k years and your most &quot;tolerant&quot; country Pakistan&#39;s official religion Islam came into existence some 1.5-1.4 k years ago that&#39;s it 😏😏😏<br>And at last -----&gt; &quot;Om namaha Shivaya&quot; <br>Jai Shree Ram, Jai Bhajarang Bali, Jai Hind 💪💪💪 There is no quote in the Bible that says to stone your brother if he leaves the Faith. Heck, Christ saved a woman from a mob who wanted to kill her, so why would he let his followers allow them to stone their own brothers?<br>As for Constantine, he never wrote a book in the Bible. The information in this video is also incorrect about the Council of Nicea. It never decided on any books in the Bible. The Council of Nicea was a debate between Arian Bishops and Catholic Bishops - Arian Christians believed Christ was a lesser God to God the Father. Catholics Christians believed in the Trinity and the concept of &quot;three persons, one God&quot; - the Catholics view won, Arianism was condemned and Constantine accepted the verdict, even though he was a supporter of Arian Christianity. After he died, his son, an Arian Christian, again began persecuting Catholic Christians. It was around 80 years later when Catholics were finally able to practise their Faith openly again. As for the Council that decided on which books were in Bible, that was the AD 397 Council of Carthage Ek dum correct...... Splendid answers Let&#39;s all report this channel and shut it down. Qyran Chapter No.9 TAWBA(REPENTANCE)<br><br>1. A declaration of immunity from God and His Messenger to the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty.<br><br>2. So travel the land for four months, and know that you cannot escape God, and that God will disgrace the disbelievers.<br><br>3. And a proclamation from God and His Messenger to the people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage, that God has disowned the polytheists, and so did His Messenger. If you repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, know that you cannot escape God. And announce to those who disbelieve a painful punishment.<br><br>4. Except for those among the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty, and did not violate any of its terms, nor aided anyone against you. So fulfill the treaty with them to the end of its term. God loves the righteous.<br><br>5. When the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists wherever you find them. And capture them, and besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every ambush. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and pay the alms, then let them go their way. God is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.<br><br>6. And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for protection, give him protection so that he may hear the Word of God; then escort him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.<br><br>7. How can there be a treaty with the polytheists on the part of God and His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque? As long as they are upright with you, be upright with them. God loves the pious.<br><br>8. How? Whenever they overcome you, they respect neither kinship nor treaty with you. They satisfy you with lip service, but their hearts refuse, and most of them are immoral.<br><br>9. They traded away God&#39;s revelations for a cheap price, so they barred others from His path. How evil is what they did.<br><br>10. Towards a believer they respect neither kinship nor treaty. These are the transgressors.<br><br>11. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and give the obligatory charity, then they are your brethren in faith. We detail the revelations for a people who know.<br><br>12. But if they violate their oaths after their pledge, and attack your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief—they have no faith—so that they may desist.<br><br>13. Will you not fight a people who violated their oaths, and planned to exile the Messenger, and initiated hostilities against you? Do you fear them? It is God you should fear, if you are believers.<br><br>14. Fight them. God will punish them at your hands, and humiliate them, and help you against them, and heal the hearts of a believing people.<br><br>15. And He will remove the anger of their hearts. God redeems whomever He wills. God is Knowledgeable and Wise.<br><br>16. Or do you think that you will be left alone, without God identifying which of you will strive, and take no supporters apart from God, His Messenger, and the believers? God is well Aware of what you do.<br><br>17. It is not for the polytheists to attend God’s places of worship while professing their disbelief. These—their works are in vain, and in the Fire they will abide.<br><br>18. The only people to attend God’s places of worship are those who believe in God and the Last Day, and pray regularly, and practice regular charity, and fear none but God. These are most likely to be guided.<br><br>19. Do you consider giving water to pilgrims and maintaining the Sacred Mosque the same as believing in God and the Last Day and striving in God’s path? They are not equal in God’s sight. God does not guide the unjust people.<br><br>20. Those who believe, and emigrate, and strive in God’s path with their possessions and their persons, are of a higher rank with God. These are the winners.<br><br>21. Their Lord announces to them good news of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gardens wherein they will have lasting bliss.<br><br>22. Abiding therein forever. With God is a great reward.<br><br>23. O you who believe! Do not ally yourselves with your parents and your siblings if they prefer disbelief to belief. Whoever of you allies himself with them—these are the wrongdoers.<br><br>24. Say, “If your parents, and your children, and your siblings, and your spouses, and your relatives, and the wealth you have acquired, and a business you worry about, and homes you love, are more dear to you than God, and His Messenger, and the struggle in His cause, then wait until God executes His judgment.” God does not guide the sinful people.<br><br>25. God has given you victory in numerous regions; but on the day of Hunayn, your great number impressed you, but it availed you nothing; and the land, as spacious as it was, narrowed for you; and you turned your backs in retreat.<br><br>26. Then God sent down His serenity upon His Messenger, and upon the believers; and He sent down troops you did not see; and He punished those who disbelieved. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.<br><br>27. Then, after that, God will relent towards whomever He wills. God is Forgiving and Merciful.<br><br>28. O you who believe! The polytheists are polluted, so let them not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year of theirs. And if you fear poverty, God will enrich you from His grace, if He wills. God is Aware and Wise.<br><br>29. Fight those who do not believe in God, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden, nor abide by the religion of truth—from among those who received the Scripture—until they pay the due tax, willingly or unwillingly.<br><br>30. The Jews said, “Ezra is the son of God,” and the Christians said, “The Messiah is the son of God.” These are their statements, out of their mouths. They emulate the statements of those who blasphemed before. May God assail them! How deceived they are! Ohh lord. I can&#39;t tell you how wrong you all are. Let&#39;s all report this video. Under Hateful category. There is no verse in the bible saying stone a non christian to death. Liar! If you find any, i dare you to reply to this comment. Dunya me jitne bhe Religion he....

Jai sree Ram.. According to Demography couple of decades going to be as a whole India&#39;s golden period. Becoz we have the highest population of youth in the world, but what are we doing  with that. This?? Hatred.?? Best fodder to destroy.. I am feeling really depressed that this what &quot;THEY&quot; teach their cadres from young age..<br>And this poor guy believes a conglomerate friendly Government is going to make India poverty free..<br>How can THEY do this to my country? such a biased interview . why u even took the interview if u dont want to accept the facts of interviewee and want to demean him on the chanell This idealog is the result of appeasement pollitics played ny Congress for almost 58 years....when u try to neglect one radical idealogy which Congress did for so many years!! It is very obvious that similar Idealogy in similar form would take place!!! A real eye opener This is not a good stuff. No matter if he is a hindu or non hindu, he should not talk against any other religion. Hahaha.. Kis Chutiye Ka Interview Le Liya! 😂😂😂 sati pratha, Widow system, Devadasi system kaunse Mughal k ane se aaye h...child marriage...RSS is Terrorist organization thanks to CIA... Muslim gaay khate hai to unko tumne kaat dia<br>Jo India beef export me No2 in the world hai, tab tum mukar gaye. Please Install a camera in any mosque or a madarsa, you&#39;ll see what level of extremism is spread over there Bhai yeh Islam or Christianity ka Dosh nhi hai isko Bina samze add Kar walo Ka Dosh ha Islam na Bola. Body cover Karo inhone muh cover karva Diya # SACHA HINDU Chill yr, we guys have to united because our enemies like Pakistan and China r happy for India&#39;s current situation. Why this idiot media is interviewing a Chai walla about religion and politics???!, go interview those who are more educated in this field, not just a layman by the street. Idiot indian media trying to make a bad image of islam and other Abrahamic religions Is chutiye  Ko baat karne aati nahi hai mazhab par khaali bakwaas kar Raha hai Gita hun main korran hun me.<br> Gita hun main korran hun me.<br>Padh Sakta he to padh ,<br>Are kafir INSAN hun main....! Proud to be Hindu Ye acha hai vai. Shanti ke liye har bar compromise hum kare aur religion of peace wo kehlaye wo? Har bar bomb blasts kare wo aur fir v religion of peace kehlaye wo? Nahi chalega. Humara haq hum le ke rahenge. Unki madad nahi karenge. Tumlogon ko jitna galiyaan dena hai do. Koi farak nahi padta Hume. Apni dharti apna raj. Hindu swaraj. I have Studied All religion And All Religions have Good and Bad Things and We have To Accept It and Only Follow Good Teachings For Humanity Proud to be Hindu and Atheist. Hinduism only religion that allows such Freedom.<br>Jai Bhaarat, Jai Shivaji, Jai Modi. We Hindus have preserved Taj Mahal, An Islamic Monument which was built by Invaders - The Mughals who murdered and enslaved our ancestors and beheaded our Beloved Sikh Gurus and destroyed our Great Wonder - The Buddhist University of Nalanda.<br><br>If Taj Mahal existed in Muslim country, It would be blown to pieces by now by Islamic terrorists like Al Qaeda, Taliban or ISIS. Yet, People have the nerve to claim Hindus are intolerant despite Hindus giving away Half of their Nation to descendants of Invaders for creation of 2 Islamic only Nations - Pakistan and Bangladesh, Not with Hatred or Evil Intentions but we gave them these Nations out of Genuine Friendship and Peace gesture. Ex : When India liberated Bangladesh in 1971, It could easily do something like China did to Tibet and re-occupied the territory claiming it as Indian but we did not !!!<br><br>What did we Indians get in return ? 4 Wars with Pakistan, Kashmir Pandit Genocide, Terrorism sponsored by Pakistan and Pakistan claiming even more land today in Kashmir. It is time for us Hindus to worry about ourselves now and make what remains today as India into a Hindu Nation before even this Great land is consumed by Monotheistic Cults that believe in dominating others and establishing supremacy. luv u rss absolutely right bro islaam ki maa ka chod Chutiya .  .  .  .  . I am Muslim and no Mai Ka laal has guts to eliminate from India i scar with nobody no one has rights to blame Muslims This is not a Hindu nationalist....... it&#39;s purely RSS Hindu nationalist....so please change the title... . This guy is not representing entire Hindu community.🙏🙏 Kis chutiye ka interview liya hai tumne? 😂😂 During the time of ashoka the girls weren&#39;t allowed to educate and there was no equality for the woman. Rape has spread through Islam? Then why did Vishnu raped a demons wife? Was Vishnu also following Islam? 😂😂 There was no violence in India before Islam? Are fucking kidding me. You think Islam created Mahabharata and Ramayana? 😂😂 What has Hinduism done to India apart from caste discrimination, stupid rituals, dirty temples, stinky swami&#39;s , million gods? I really don&#39;t understand what these people want? Just blindly sympathizing a 10,000 year old stone age culture that hasn&#39;t done any good to India. Sir if you want go this way, better to open Blood bank for you people and get back all Indian Hindus from Muslim &amp; Christian country &amp; break long line of RSS people for USA green card. If you want to change try to open more school for people like Christian what  already opened. Am also from Saraswati Sishu Vidya Mandir I am anti Islam because we have been forcefully removed from Pakistan before 1947 Good Citizen, Salutes Thank You In my humble opinion, there is no difference between a Hindu nationalist and Islamic fundamentalist. Both are chutiyas. Both live in a dream and believe that people of their religion have been subjected to violence and partiality. And most importantly, I have never seen any without distorted facts about history. School me jab history padhai jati thi, tab sale chawal maarte the. Ab dekho kese hostorians bane firte hai. <br><br>For that matter, every religious hardliner out there, no matter from which faith, will tell you that they have had enough now. Enough of &#39;injustice&#39;. Just think, if everyone is a victim, then who is the culprit? B.j.p rapist party hei  aur is admi aukat  kya hai jo bole kuran aur baibel par who rape don&#39;t have religion. and who support them are also rapist. and recently we saw lots of rapist on the news in support of rapist.  but no one care. because it is good for politicians for next election by support them on the name of religion. shame on Indian politics. My god and your god is a stupid mentality. Just wait for all these people who believe in God&#39;s to die out and then we&#39;ll have a more peaceful society. This is what uneducated literary is all about.Shame i agree with him but i have respect for Christians also....this video has unsolicited information Fabricated Whatever religious esteem u follow just leave in peace 😃 Baat sahi kahi specially in context of islam which believes just in hatred and killing of others Level of stupidity is infinite here 😂😂 I feel bad for what ever happened to his family in Pakistan but that dose not mean you start fight against any religion.<br><br>I also feel bad for the wrong knowledge given to him. the diplomat is one of the psedu secularasshole...it jut scratches western media balls.. Ok if rss so good and ethical then why didn&#39;t the got bharat ratan blinded by religion. if really christianity teaches to kill non believers then show how many till now were being killed. U.S.A is a christian country , so it must have used atom bomb on india rather than japan.  dont follow blindly. know that all humans are equal. if u want to protect hinduism then start preaching it. no one is opposing it. but if u r taking arms into your hands then its show how weak the ideology u r believing in , which needs help of humans. ONE WHO TEACHES TO KILL OTHER HUMANS CAN NEVER BE A GOD. cant sri RAM handle a human, he want help of other human??? do u think u r more powerful than ur own GOD?  you urself making your GOD powerless and shameful.  OPEN UP UR EYES BEFORE ITS TOO LATE. Muslim women ki agar baat kare toh wo toh all over world parda system follow karti hai bt kyu aisa gaao mei ladies sir k pallu ko kamar tak rakhti hai or sheher mei kamar se neeche kapre nahi pehenti.. nd neways bhai ramayan parlo aapki sita maata bhi apni ankles tak cover karke rakhti thi or ha aaj bhi hamare yaha parda follow kara jaata hai education hindrance nahi Copied from the Quint I am just shocked! We got inside the mind of a Hindu nationalist.... Likewise there would be &#39;nationalists&#39; of Islam and Christianity and/or other religions as well.... Imagine if these guys hold the rope of our nations.... Where is the country heading to? Indians will never learn,your entire existence is a joke, no one really takes you seriously. Man this video is pretty disturbing to watch. To sit day after day, declining in morale and hope ,is just disappointing. Why is it so incomprehensible for people to believe that we don&#39;t matter.We are weak, we are small and of no consequence in the universe.They want to be the agents, not the victims, of history. They identify with God&#39;s power and believe they are godlike. That is their basic madness. They are overcome by some archtype; their egos have expanded psychotically so that they cannot tell where they begin and the godhead leaves off. It is not hubris, not pride; it is inflation of the ego to its ultimate — confusion between him who worships and that which is worshipped. Man has not eaten God; God has eaten man. He is speaking utter bullshit. I hope he knows what happened with Draupadi, she was humiliated in front of everyone. Best thing is just watch the video stay calm and move on! You can’t change there thinking, truth prevails! all kinds of extremists is disgrace for humanity and millions of goods people <br>these people are full of hatred and bullshitt propaganda Why don’t you ask the same question to a Muslim fundamentalist (if you hav guts because I don’t think you will be left alive by these talibabis) ? Every thing he is said true people are always misled to fight in the name of religion <br>religion is misused as a garb <br>politics full of rivalry enmity hatred self centeredness greed of power etc etc is behind religious violence<br>even this interview stinks of only political views I salute your thinking Jai hindu Vedas k reference dene k baad bhi ye unpad gavar log maan ne k liye tiyyar nai.padho apni vedas band karo apni bakwas.bolti band hojayegi tumhari jab padhoge vedas.99.99 percent hindus dont know wat der vedas say.plz read it n u will cum to know.without reading your vedas dis kind of chutiya people wil say like dis.religiously illustrate.bechare Sab kuchh galat hone mein Islam  and Christianity jimmedar hai...what a logic of RSS book 😀😁😂 bhai aise schools mein padhoge toh yahi kuchh sikhne Ko milega This guy is not a &#39;hindu&#39;, he is a &#39;chutiya&#39;. Bhai ne pehle dialogue me hi Dil Jeet Lia.😂 Hahaha &quot;Shining India&quot; 😂😂😂 indians are expert in making other people fool. Check out at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a> this is the Reality of India, then they blame Pakistan for their flaws. hahaha...mera desh badal rha hai. Islam k ane k baad to Ladkiya bachi hai pehle to paida hote hi maar dete the..aur abhi bhi kai jagah Hinduo me ladkiya mari jati hai... Ladkiya chedne me Number One man By Hindu Scripture was Krishna ye is jahil ko kon bataiga The killer of Humanity and Non Violence BJP And RSS RSS And BJP Terrorism.... Very Good..<br>RSS Jindabad.. Hahahaha gandooo जय श्री राम What he told here is a fact har har mahadev The man in the video has valid points . Also I want to mention that the counter-points stated in the video against the points mentioned by the man is baseless and false. Quran does quotes about intolerance against non-muslims. Many new tools had been implemented in the New Testament just for politics and social control with which Jesus had no links . And India had a matriarchal society if you truly know or learned about India&#39;s ancient history , especially Ramayana &amp; Mahabharata . The title of video says its about a group of people which is Hindu Nationalists. <br>The second line of the video says the views expressed do not reflect the position of any group or political party.<br>The title is a gimmick to attract flies. The disclaimer is science and logic. <br>Are you a fly or a human? &quot;there is no compulsion in Islam&quot; : The Glorious Quran. <br>Liar doing propaganda about Islam. wrong quotations of Quran. shame.......... Sati pratha kon krta tha he is convinced by critically He is saying every word 100 % true....What is wrong to be a Hindu Nationalist...Great video.....and Great thought... If you don&#39;t have any problem with muslims and if u feel that Muslims are nice people, then remember that they are nice with you because Islam teaches them to be nice with everyone. So you should respect islam as it is the religion of peace. 800 saal mughal ne raaj kiya tab Hindu khatre me nahi tha, 200 saal Britishers ne raaj kiya tab Hindu khatre me nahi tha, 60 saal congress ne raaj kiya tab Hindu khatre me nahi tha. Ab achanak bjp k aate hi Hindu apne aap ko khatre me mehsus karne laga hai. Waah gobar bhakto. Kitna hamare Hindu bhaiyo k saamne aur zaher ugloge. meanwhile UNESCO just declared islam as the most peaceful religion in the world Every religion has its strengths n weaknesses. Even Hinduism with its rigid caste system n its gender inequalities,not to mention the deep rooted superstitions. Yes we are conservative hindu nationalists ! Deal with it ! Sad that he thinks this. :( You  pick any one random person from the street and want people to think this is the mindset of all one  Billion Hindu ?<br>Do u guys leave logic and common -sense at home when making a documentary about India ? The comments on this video are a true indicator that such mindset is not limited to few unhinged mind, but is a widespread rot in our society regardless of education one gets.<br>I am an Indian and very much familiar with this ideology, and I can confirm this is not one off thing. Most middle aged men and women in North Indian states have this view, and now this is polluting youth&#39;s mind too Modi bagat.... Jab tu baccha tha, to tabhi se teri khopdi pe nafrad ke zeher farta raha hai sangh. Sudhar jao dost, dharam nahi bhuke ped ke dard hai sabse iham mazla. Secularism in hindi is dharamnirpekshak, matlab sarkar ko dharam se kuch lene dena nahi hai. these illiterate dumbhead has a very very very little knowledge about Islam.<br><br>these stupid is barking what he learned in his gaushala/asharam.<br><br>Morocco Islamic University had given the first right for women education ,way before British.<br><br><br>and this dumbhead says that Women abusement is cause of ISLAM?<br><br>if people like this thinking live for some more years then this country is doomed. He is correct !!!!!! Whole world facing problem with Christian and Muslim. All religion is shit but these two are worse. Tum jaise Hindu Hai to dharm ki chinta nahi This country is still a democratic secular not because of minorities but be coz the Hindus are liberal and tolerant..... And don&#39;t try to take advantage of there tolerance .......... Tell me one muslim majority country where muslims treat their minorities as they are treated in India.......... Oh he is talking of karmas.but i am sure he does not know it&#39;s effect.he is hurting <a href=\"http://himself.be/\">himself.be</a> happy. If this is what hindu religious person be than why should one become religious.hindu word is not seen in any vedic literature.and religion is not of spreading hate.he has been brainwashed by rss.may he and all beings be happy. Very good expose&#39;!<br>Although, apart from every abhorrent things he said, nothing he said about Quran and bible is false.<br>Deuteronomy 13:6-10 tells about killing brother and other family members for worshipping other gods. <br>And many books of bible were written down long after jesus, though not as late as during time of Constantine. 100% support your words talking about Islam without knowledge is like praying to cows like Hindus&lt;because they are fit for each other Don&#39;t degrade the name of Guru Gobind Singh Vande Mataram 🇮🇳 What about Islam fundamentals who gave birth to terrorists and terrorist organisations like Lashkar-e-Taiba,ISIS etc? Liberals are worried about Modi who is considered as a Hindu nationalist world leader, world still is unware of the next PM after Modi he is a Monk called Yogi the guy is a real badass, the world politics will change once he becomes the PM in 2024, it will be fun to see Hyper level panic among pseudo-liberals Well said sir we salute you Hindu unity is must this man is a perfect example of fool (BHAKT) knowledgeable fool. हमारे इस्लाम के बारे में कहने से पहले अपने धर्म के बारे में जानो जिस धर्म में तुम हो हमारा मजहब इस्लाम सारे इल्म का सरताज है हमारा दिन मुकम्मल है हमें उस पर अमल की जरूरत है हमें अच्छा माहौल बनाने की जरूरत है लोगों के बहकावे से बचने की जरूरत है फिल्मी दुनिया के गंदे कारनामों से बचने की जरूरत है ............... अल्लाह पाक ने इस्लाम से पहले और भी मजहब दुनिया में भेजा है इस्लाम जब तक नहीं आया था इस दुनिया में उससे पहले औरतों का बहुत बुरा हाल था ऐसा हाल था कि बच्चियों को पैदा होते ही मार दिया जाता था और बहुत से लोगों के यहां आज भी यह माना जाता है कि लड़की पैदा हो गई तो अपशगुन हो गया इस्लाम में सबसे पहले तालीम के लिए ही बताया गया है इस्लाम की पहली आयत है इकरा इकरा का मतलब पढ़ाई से है एजुकेशन से है  इस्लाम पूरी दुनिया वालों के लिए अल्लाह का एहसान है Tu toh jalebi ki tarah sidha lagra. Munne Made a good point at the end, that he wishes nobody dies from hunger in India ever again.<br><br>Came here expecting something else, however the man made some good points, especially considering most BJP/Modi fans do not The diplomat please tell about Muslim Views towards Non-Muslims Peoples. <br>Hindu are always better than Lovely people in the world even though some become radical due to some reason. Please love India and Indian. Salman Jisne Ashok Ka Naam Liya Hai Ashok Ne kitne Hindu ke katle Aam Kiya Hai aaj bahut sari cheez hai Jo Tumhe chahiye toh main jawab Jarur Doonga Mujhe Jarur message karna Islam Ko takat Banaya Gaya Hai Kyun Ke Duniya Mein sabse Zyada popularity Islam ki hai aur Aane Wale Chinese me musalmano ki aabadi aur in ki lokpriya se banne Wali Hai Jab tak Islam ke sath nahi bolega Salman bahut hi sahi bola usne sati pratha Islam Ne Diya choti nabalik bachi se shadi karna ke Islami sikhe vidhwa ki shadi nahi karna Yeh Salam Nazar kya hai Yeh Islam ko Badnam karne ke liye Ye RSS wale aur BJP Wale Hai Totally fake I&#39;m not an indian and im not a muslim, im a christian <br>This man is speaking out of complete hatred. YOU can see it from his message.<br>We christians dont have a god who kill for throphy or popularity. We have a God who love the sinners and paid for their sin. THATS THE TRUTH ABOUT CHRISTIANITY Kha se atte he ese log. Well said brother.... And excellent knowledge i want to correct you Mr. Putin is not anti- Islam &amp; Mrs. Merkel is also not a anti- Islam Islam aaney se pehle vidhwa aurton KO  zinda jalaya jata tha , Sati pratha bhool Gaye kya?  PK ho kya? After watching this vid, I can confidently say without prejudice or any doubt whatsoever that, he&#39;s a fucking idiot. when you do it is right but when this thing is done by muslim then he is terrorist.This is dual standard. And muslims don&#39;t allow killing of innocent men or any women, child or oldly guys And that is why bal gangadar tilak is called &#39;father of terrosim&#39; either the diplomat take Indian people to be a guaranteed fool or they don&#39;t or care social fabric of Indian subcontinent....just wanna a report... yeah they have good reporting style....but that don&#39;t convert  a lie into a truth I&#39;m scared of where India, my country is headed towards. The most scary part is that the majority of the people also want the same. I pray that my country doesn&#39;t become like Pakistan or Syria or Iraq etc. We have the potential of becoming the greatest country in the world and we can set an example for the rest of the world.

Hindu nationalism grown out of the fear of islam and christianity. The aim of hindu nationalism is to create a society based on chathurvarna, means eternal suffering for the lower castes and dalits. Hatred towards other faiths that pose a threat like semitic faiths. Jainism and sikhism somehow integrated and dont pose a threat, budhiam diminished. The manipulator oh sorry, maker of this video has cleverly tried to paint the person wrong when he pointed out wrong preachings in Islam and Christianity. But he could not give any credible statement like interpretation has been made as such according some scholars(no scholar name given). Now I don&#39;t know about bible but Quran has many ridiculous preachings, if a person has actually read it, he can&#39;t deny it as this is a fact. Except for those 10 or 12 statements, Quran does really well as a religious book. But those 10 or 12 statements have made the entire Middle East Asia and North Africa, a hub of Jihadi mindset. And yes, Jihad literally means &quot;Armed Assault&quot; as far as Quran goes. Again, there is one statement that talks about waging Jihad against one&#39;s inner demons is also as much important\\u200b. Quran has some seriously contradicting statements and therefore people are using it either ways. But bloodshed is real and it should have opened the eyes by now but sadly, video manipulated in this way by such money driven leaches are helping the problem to grow. This video shows low IQ of todays media. They can&#39;t give facts to counter and throw vaguely generic statements instead without even thinking what is their responsibility as media. I hate RSS but love Hindus they are Friendly peoples. Love and support to our Hindu brothers, greetings from Israel. I supprort his thought deeply I am proud to be nationalist They have total problems with Islam and muslims 🙄 Islam is really cruel The Diplomat is too biased. Bhai 15% logo ne 80%logo Ko sikhaya ke ladaki Ko naa paday or unke haq chine jook kar raha hai kya he is not a sikh !! he is quoting  guru gobind singh jis words bt he is not sikh <br>hindu and sikh are two diffrent religion ! Guys don&#39;t believe in such videos. You will come across many videos by foreign funded media houses. What they do is they ask a loose ended question. And then they edit the parts which suits according to their agenda. And then they sell it around the globe . Pls dont blindly follow. These people are in business of tarnishing Hindu culture, Sanatan Dharma, and most importantly India. I am myself a hindu nationalist and a scholar in the scripture (jewish , Christian and islamic) I agree what he said about Quran at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m00s\">2:00</a> but what he said about Christianity is wrong. This guy said nothing wrong. He understands the way things are and have been. What makes you think he is a representative of hindu mindset...stop doing that...this is not good at all how are these people born &quot;UltE&quot; or &quot;GND&quot; SE To be Hindu Nationalist you gotta have something to be proud of! India is the toilet of the world and been either colonized or defeated through out history. plus you know nationalism doesn&#39;t really end well, if we look back at history  -- Rape on India you suck Each and every word that this man said was true Now make a video on, &quot;The mind of a person who thinks above the concepts of religion.&quot; We all need that. Please help me understand if to cry or laugh out loud.. Damn.. Are waaa the <a href=\"http://diplomat.com/\">diplomat.com</a> is also owned by a muslim is it ? If not then y dnt ull go in kashmir n ask kids abw thoughts on india n i openly totally support this guy fuck u Reporter u have balls to ask same to ISIS??? Christian?? Islamic????? Chutiya reporter People are judging him by his views but nobody has asked what happened to his family when he was in Pakistan. The title is misleading...........!!!! You only portray the worst. This guy does not define a Hindu Nationalist. Seculars  should be killed in shambhulal style.they are traitors of India How much you paid that guy? And how much you got from missionaries and likes of JuM, LeT? Why not talk to a isis supporters and separatist in Kashmir they will give you much spicy answers <br>Because this man was holding himself back on few topics Too much politics within religion! All religions!<br>Religion after all is there so that rulers have a certain degree of control over the masses! <br>To instil fear in the minds of sinners! Fear in front of the Almighty! <br>You know what, I fear God! I know the latter is in charge of my destiny to a certain degree!<br>We should all Fear God!...It/he can BLESS but also CURSE! i support this guy, well it is so lamentable,\\r<br> that exits the religious violence, i am sure the majory of the people who call themselves muslims are great people.\\r<br>but the islam is a cancer,it is uncompatible witht the human right. Stoning your Brother, Found in Bible  :<br><br>Deuteronomy 13:6-10<br><br> If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other),  do not yield to them or listen to them. <br><br>Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. Stone them to death, because they tried to turn you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.Deuteronomy 13:6-10  <br><br>Killing Polytheists and Harassing them, Found in Quran :<br><br>Qurab Al-Tawbah (9:5)<br><br>And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. This man is probably suffering from some kind of serious psychological problem. This channel placed India on 4th no. In terms of countries with the most religious unrest whereas Israel, Yemen , Afghanistan, Pakistan etc ranked lower than it , is this channel really familiar with the national and international affairs ? Why are you portraying afterlines on video instead of saying direct to him, fools he is approximately <a href=\"http://right.at/\">right.at</a> certain points like..christianity o muslims... a better words might be used is...they had been used as a tool to prohibit the growth of middle east and southern asia which are very rich in resources either human or natural. 70 years of politics made dem whabi.. before that muslims as i kno were open to the science Jai rss Only if he could read a book of science , common sense book , or followed the basic Hinduism (Basic each religion = peaceunto world) Waah kya insaan hai aur kya soch  hai iska..isko ye acha nai laga ki kuch log unko naya naam diya bahudev vadi..aur inko ye acha laga ki agar baat se na mane toh maro..these are d kind of people who make rules as per their own profit and interest..his thinking is that rape disrespecting women and killing innocent came from Islam..please someone tell him personally that Draupadi (a character in their religious text named MAHABHARAT) was was sold by them for sake of winning a game and then they tried to undress her..now tell me was there any muslim in MAHABHARAT..idiot guy stop saying non sense..and start respecting others religion..and media please..u made video on a hindu mans mind its ok but at the end u sould have concluded by saying that this mans thinking is wrong...u just made this and uploaded its like u guys are also supporting this guys thoughts.. Well i&#39;m living in Germany and i&#39;ve never heard that Angela Merkel ever shown hate towards Muslims. The truth is that she&#39;s the one who always helps Muslim Assylumseekers. The whole interview is &quot;Unsubstantiated&quot; Idol worshipping pagan ! RSS is the Indian equivalent for Nazis, please dont lynch me for making this comment. Hindu hone pe mujhe Garv hai 🚩 Islam is the cure to humanity as a cancer is a cure for the living body BHaktards &amp; Pseudo nationalist saffron turds have understood history as per their convenience to propage their right wing terrorism called Hindutva ! No surprise here if you see this jackass his head is full of cow shit &amp; piss ! Though I don&#39;t support him completly,but I love hinduism and I must say that Hindu should be more brave for their own survival wow.....what a propoganda video Forget the past and live together So sickening thought Bible pad jakar....<br>isahiyat ko manne vale ko nhi bevkuf.....<br><br>jo ishwar(pita parmeshwar) ke  kalpanoa ka palan na karke pap mai ji rha ho ....use bande ya bandi ko .....<br>uske ya uski mat pita samjaye ...use sahi raste par laye ....nhi mane society ke wise elders yani budiman bujurg log ke pas ja kar samjao..nhi samje toh aise santan ko gao ya shahar ke phatak ke bahr ja khar patar maro....<br><br>ye old testment mai hai moses ke laws mai....<br><br><br>duniya mai jitne bhi court ke laws woh sab Christian dharam ne <br>MOSES ya musa ke niyamo se liya hai....bevkuf khi ka....<br><br>bible alag logne.... jesus christ shiksha ko chiti ke duara kisi dusre vyakti ke liye likta.....<br>jesus christ ke shiksha ko NewTestament....<br>unse pahle ke shiksha joh moses aur unke bad aye nabi ne lika tha.....<br><br>constantine bas in sabko ek kitab ke roop sangatith kiya tha bevkuf <br>history sahi kar apni Bible pad jakar....<br>isahiyat ko manne vale ko nhi bevkuf.....<br><br>jo ishwar(pita parmeshwar) ke  kalpanoa ka palan na karke pap mai ji rha ho ....use bande ya bandi ko .....<br>uske ya uski mat pita samjaye ...use sahi raste par laye ....nhi mane society ke wise elders yani budiman bujurg log ke pas ja kar samjao..nhi samje toh aise santan ko gao ya shahar ke phatak ke bahr ja khar patar maro....<br><br>ye old testment mai hai moses ke laws mai....<br><br><br>duniya mai jitne bhi court ke laws woh sab Christian dharam ne <br>MOSES ya musa ke niyamo se liya hai....bevkuf khi ka.... islamic propaganda is to destroy hindu and sikhs ye video dekh ke ye confirm ho gaya ki india and indians kabhi nahi bandlenge. desh fir se gulami me jane wala hai... actualy gulami me hai... sari technologies jo aaj hum use krte hai wo dusare desho ki den hai... iski wajah aise log hai.. jo dharm ko desh se bada mante hai... shame on such ideology. .. sharm kro He’s knowledge on islam and Christianity  is so bleak  . Kudos to this guy Haha! He forgot to mention that in India there were many incidents where a woman was set on fire alive at during the cremation of her husband&#39;s body. :) This guy is full of shit. He is proud of things he has not contributed to. This person is ill informed. The verses of surah taubah speak about the times when  Holy Prophet Muhammed S.A.S declared his prophethood and starting speading islam and the belief in one god. There was a huge plot to kill him and kill all the people who accepted islam.  After this there was peace treaty signed between the followers of Islam and the polytheists . The Polytheists  then broke the treaty and starting killing muslims again. Then Allah asked the muslims to fight back against only those people who are waging war against the muslims. It specifically mentioned not to hurt the polytheists who are not hurting the muslims and accepted the treaty of peace.<br><br>Surah Taubah Verse Number 4 <br><br>4. Except those idolaters with whom you made an agreement, who then did not show any latitude (in executing the treaty) and who did not support (or reinforce) anyone against you. So fulfil the treaty with them till the end of the term. Surely, Allah loves those who fear Him. <br><br>Islam is a religion of peace and the Quran is a book of peace 3.1k dislikes by crazy And bhakts who only spread lies and hate Well said ! You follow yours we follow yours ! Muslims of india have no respect! This is what jinnah said umar  bhar inko  apni  deshbhakti jatav    phir b Yeh  nhi manege  ! completely brain washed.. and lots of people filled like this in india.. in both the community.. you need to use your brain too.. never follow the sheep in que... <br><br>read quran understand it and comment on islam..<br>read bible and judge Christianity.<br>read vedas, bhagwat geeta  and judge Hindus.<br><br> dont judge by cropping the lines.. and listening to others..<br><br>i dont paint all with same brush, because of this guy i will not hate my all hindu friends.. neither they hate me because of some fundamental muslim.. he is real Indian he is real Indian The bottom line is there are sick f—ks like this in every country which have some beef (pun intended) against some religion or race...bin ladens gonna be proud of you man cox ur all from the same breed This is wrong allegation by him there is nothing written in bible to kill others. In fact our commandment 6 says you shall not murder. Fuck this idiot he studied from RSS based school he drafted it very well bt at one point he gets fail nd shows that he gets brain washed ..... otherwise it is a  video nd it can be edited also ... There is only one thing in common with the countries with the most religious unrest, they all have large amounts of muslim people living in them. These kinda interviews are roots of communal riots... But I am happy these kinda people are getting old and new generation is smart enough to make development their first priority and religion their personal interest... Inspite of being a Hindu nationalist this person is really articulate and logical. If everyone of the bhakts was this logical, we could&#39;ve reached a conclusion. What about the caste system ? I bet he’s not read the Hindu religious book Geeta... the same things are written in their book ... 🙄 <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wI3XYnc1YVQ\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wI3XYnc1YVQ</a>.<br><br>Watch it. Bhia app Ka knowledge assmanope hi app to buss Einstein ki baap ho utterly nonsense seems like this interview totally concocted scripted Bhai islam is not about eating beef and islam is not about beating or letting others down Not even once in bible, it says to stone those who are not christians.  This is the problem of lack of knowledge of other religion.  In fact christianity teaches to show the other cheek to those who beat you.  The entire teaching of Jesus is to forgive and love your enemies.  I would like to know where in bible it says to stone a non christian? what a douchebag..if he shows that verse in bible that u hv to stone ur brother if he doesnt believe in christ i will leave christanity right nw..infact when pharasiees brought a prostitute to stone her to death jesus asked them among u who hasnt done any sin will be the first to stone her..he saved her...jesus said to his disciples go n proclaim the gospel to eveeyone..if a town or city not welcoming u just shake dust off ur feet n walk away....let them face the judgement day..those who hv ear let them hear..😎 He is quoting verses of Bible and Islam which r against humanity. <br>But if we dig in Hindu scriptures we will find  rules which were against humans like shudras, women and widows. Like cut the toungue of shudra if he speaks against king. Make widows deaf by hot mercury so that they cant listen sacred mantras. <br>My obesrvation is that no one has clean hand. <br>We mixed society and religion. we made rules for society in the name of religion.<br>And believe me if we were not the oldest and if there were other religions at the time,  we would also had made rules to kill Muslim and Christians. Just bcz there were no compeition we made punishing rules for our own people.<br>But now we evolved form those things. May be one day they (muslims and christans) will also shun these verses. PK ha keya Sunwayi ho rahi hai gundo ki ...gundo ki sarkar He is absolutely rt..well said.. 3k Hindu nationalists didn&#39;t liked the video...Keep up the good work. he is right Bullshit <br>Is k dil me khunnas hai isne ISLAM ko smjha or parha nh h bs bakwas krta hai. he stated facts... U could not face truths The Christian minorities haven&#39;t displayed any violence. Even the claims of forced conversions are silly, as they are both socailly and economically the countries weakest people. Why the animosity against Christians? Is this feeling still left over from colonization? I have noticed anytime someone points out something Muslims are currently doing, some Muslim apologist points out colonization.... which was 400 years ago. Consider how today, Hindus living and studying in Christian nations like Russia or any Latin American country are without complaint. Russia is arguable the world&#39;s most Christian country, consider their treatment of India on a geopolitical level. Consider also that Hindus in Nagaland have no complaints. This persecution is unfounded. He&#39;s stupid as fuck Abe gaumutaar peene wle agr Islam ki wajh se muslamo mulko Mae sab se kum ladkio k saath ghalt Kam hota hai...tere &quot;Hindu&quot; Hindustan Mae  har second ladkio ka rape hor ha hai Bagua aatwadi <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hindu\">#hindu</a> nationalist 😂😂😁😁😁😁😀 I dont agree with thi guy philosophy he himself says his family taught him in rss supported school so he has developed that mentalality and its a fact that other relgion people never under stand the the people of the book and on his point of perciulation of hindus every community in the world in some of the other time was supressed and still getting supressed and how shamefully he is justifying killing of muslims n cristian i wonder why he has these guts to say this shit thats becos he is sitting in india and drinking tea knowing tha in democracy every one has his rights to say whatever he can foolish fellow i feel pity on him these are the people which are used by the bjp for riots and when at the time of partition muslin were also killed in india by hindus nad they also have to leave there land anh homes ho he is a bullshit guy Quran is a piece of shit open book, go look it clearly says to kill those who worship many gods. Inn Sanghis ka chale to yeh Rawan ko bhi Muslim bata na de He&#39;s saying Islam has bought/forced illiteracy among women. Someone educate this fool. This Bhai doesn&#39;t seem to have Muslim and Christians friend. Please make friends and talk talk and talk. You will feel better and your poison will ooze out...☺️☺️ At the end of this century it wont matter, at the pace people are leaving religion and become atheists religion will fall. Plus with the mix of automation, AI, and technology, people will truly start to see less opportunity and will start to doubt the existence of god and all religions even more. Trust me all religions are poison and with a mix of uneducated people due to poverty it becomes an uncontrollable problem. The man his reasons ,as he tells us how he was treated when Pakistan was created Akbar ke time me hindu sayd Muslim se bhi jyada secure the. Present time me ho kya rha hai ki sab berozgaari se Mar rhe hai or koi sunne ko teyar nhi hai. Abhi to hum hindus ki govt hai India me fir bhi itne preshan kyu hai log. Hindu - Muslim kuch ni hota bhaiya. Jisko moka milta hai mze leta hai or chala jata hai. Na to hindu ache hai or na hi muslman. Log opportunist hai koi kisi ki nhi sochte or kuch log apne swarth ke liye sab logo ko hindu Muslim disputes me uljha rakha hai taki sachai tak pahunch hi na paaye. Bas yahi chal rha hai Women teasing started after Islam ?what about Mahabharat ? I see some fallacies but on over-all basis his seems pretty sane. We as a society choose not to talk about issues and neither do we choose to integrate with other communities. <br>We need communal integration<br>Once the basic social security is provided to everyone I&#39;m also a hindu nationalist but I don&#39;t want to trouble any innocent muslim or Christian.I want to contribute for the well being of India.Jai Shri Ram ढोल गवाँर सूद्र पसु नारी ।सकल ताड़ना के अधिकारी ॥ salo gai ke aulado tum logo ka dimagh bhi gai ke tarah hai, Abe kya Chutiya insaan hai ye..... in saalon k Dimagh ki jagha Cow Dung! bhara hua hai.... the should not be &#39;The Mind of a Hindu Nationalist&#39;,,,instead it should be &#39;The Mind of a Hindu Nationalist and How I think it&#39;s wrong&#39;  :P<br><br>if u want to focus on truth don&#39;t give your opinion. thank u. He looks like an educated person bcz Constantine is known by very less people. what is the problems with building mosques in every lane , in lucknow or places where there is need ,  maszids are never govt funded , it take 5 -10years to complete the construction of a mosque and the finance come from people living in that locality nor any government or any administered body ...he is having prob with that ...and he is blaming ISLAM for girls gettting raped and harassment and molestations ...wow great ..first know about the value ofWOMEN in islam and than accuse ...he is brain washed from early stages of life as he himself cleared it that he has recieved basic education from RSS affliated school and he is GODSEWADI ..so we dont have any prob with that as majority of our countries citizen wont agree with him ...thats the beauty of secularism and democracy r u kidding me, opinion must be of majority not of single person Christianity and islam, both of them colonialist religion, both of them believe in jesus Western stupid media try to make him look bad.... western country has no idea how big problem muslim population has become in india.. most in west bengal.. Are bewkoof admi, India me 75% Hindu hai 13℅ Muslim. Gawar khi ke padhai likhayi ki Hoti to samazh me aata ki politicians tumhe vote bank ke liye use kar rhe hai . Modi ki chatna band kr tum jaiso bewkoofo ki wajah se hi Desh luta pda hai. BJP supports hatred and violence. This man is a piece of shit. Hahahahahaha LMAO.. hahahaha This pseudo secularism is fake. India&#39;s enomeis are poverty and lack of infrastructure. Even a terrorist can justify his doings. Stop supporting ppl like this. Help entrepreneurs who would help d society not this kind of ppl.<br>Once u go back to religious nonsense everything&#39;s will be doomed. I have no grudge with you brother.<br>I really wanna assure you that Islam doesn&#39;t say to kill kafirs until they start threatening Muslims for a war.<br>I think sir you are being biased here... I request you to read the Hindi version of Quran.<br>I know Hinduism has the teaching of love and peace in Vedas and I expect my Muslim brothers to respect Hinduism as this is India&#39;s cultural Religion.<br>I individually love Rakhsha Bandhan and Diwali and I find these festivals extremely lovely.<br>Let&#39;s not divide our country or else it will become a Hindu Pakistan.<br>Sri Ram doesn&#39;t hate me and Allah doesn&#39;t hate you! Its a Fake video Evanae polulla nanam ketta thendikal annu India enna county yudae sapam. He didn&#39;t know the actual truth  about other religions. He just follow what his leader says. RSS mind washes such idiots and turn them into terrorists.<br>Ban RSS and save India. and he is liar. This person is mentally sick he needs to hospitalized. I wonder if whole RSS is like this. RSS ka hai Angrezon ke zamane mein  unke samne apni tale hilate the. Duniya mein sab se zyada expand horaha religion Islam hai issliye sab hi iske enimy hain. Voh khud kaheta hai ke voh gandhi wad nahin hai to godse ka chela hai. Quran mein kaheen nahin ilkha hai ke bila wajhe kisi ko bhi maro.

I like this guy hahaahaha<br>blame pakistan<br>your failure blame pakistan😅😅😅 this guy spoke truth on many levels Sahi bol raha hai Bhaai JAI SRI RAM This is why educated youngsters who strive for change often leave the country. India has a rigid and orthodox society fit to exist in the stone ages. people have such a shallow way of thinking. to he honest everything that this man said was wrong. <br>rape and not educating women came after Islam in India? wonderful. what about sati? caste system which cripples the country even to this date? <br>blame other religions for your shallow culture and retarded ideologies. What he said is true..we don&#39;t have to live under a shadow of fear anymore.. Ladkiyon ko education deny krni wali baat to sahi hai..... Islam mein<br>Lekin... Lekin<br>Delhi rape case mein 6 mein se 5 rapist Hindu the.....ha ya na? &quot;Pathar se mardo&quot; is never mentioned in bible. It is a peaceful religion like any other. If anybody has said that, then it is his/her personal opinion. He don&#39;t know anything about Christianity ! <br>Those verus are not from the Bible .. uh can&#39;t blame anyone without knowing .. Sick mindset This guy has good heart 💓 but has a darkened one Indra raped ahilya was that because of Muslim , this guy is idiot pls don&#39;t listen to him The man is saying the facts... I actually agree him with his enemy being Islam and Christianity. Muslims are brothers, Islam isn’t It was so ironic when he gave example of Draupadi... She was assaulted in front of many people and all her Husbands. Her husbands bet on her and lost her because she was their PROPERTY. Now who taught these things to Mahabharat people? aman singh Chandigarh  lol hindu people are the most generous people .... they go to every worship place whether it be mosque mandir or gurudwara..... <br>keep on your propaganda  even you know the truth Death to India 🇮🇳🐄 Death to India 🇮🇳🐄 Demeted bastard!

Jesus in his word never say any where to harm any one india is the fourth worst country in the world for religious nonviolence after syria nigeria n iraq respectively asshole So you can call it &#39;hindu nationalist&#39; but cannot call &#39; Islamic terrorism&#39; there&#39;s a word in dictionary called &#39;hypocrite&#39; stick it on your forehead.<br>And he does not represent all Hindus in India, there are 50-60 crore Hindus in India he does not represent 1%of that. Even people like him are there, let&#39;s take a theoretical number of 20 lakh which is just 0.333% of total Hindu population so don&#39;t blame all people for this kind of people. To  THE DIPLOMAT  -  If you are  honest and truthful -  you must   tell   the name of the  person   who  wrote this  news  video .    Don&#39;t hide   behind   anonimity.

Islam is not open but a   closed  society.  Islam is most intolerant. Islam is  most violent .   Islam is  most fascist ,  totalitarian, dogma.<br>In Islam   the basic  fact that  everything is base don inequality .  Islam is cruel. blood thirsty death cult. see the punishments.  Mohammad violated all highest human values.<br>Christianity is similar   to Islam .<br>References   will be given .<br><br>Do not  import your  ideas  and impos eon  INDIA /Hindu dharma .<br>Hindu dharma  is  supremely noble and infinitely enlightening  with kindness, compassion.<br>you are assaulting on INDIA / INDIANS  ,  even after 1000 yrs   slavery . To the diplomat  staff-   First you must  establish your  credibility.   You are biased. you are prejudiced  .  You have your  preconceived   , fixed  ideas, agenda .  You  have your bent of mind .   Unless  , you come out of these   predilections,   what you write  has  little   credibility.<br>You may show   that you are   doing   your job.   But it is not  impassionate,   it is not objective , it  doe snot reflect  100% truth .<br>The proof is    this  story in the video.   That   guy also  is not as  savvy   as you guys  . <br><br>First know the true history ,  history of world, history  of INDIA .   History of ISLAM  and Christianity .   Do not  write your own   imagined views .  particularly  about  religions like   ISLAM and Christianity.    Read  their  books  -   SIRA, HADIS  and QURAN  first  -   instead   you  stupidly talk about   ISLAMIST   (self-  hard core  JIHADIST  )  view !!!   you  write  the view of a  hard core crusaders view  on Christianity   and  justify it   !!!<br>Did you read  ISLAMIC books ?  Did you read Bible  ( OT and NT  )???<br>ISLAM  and Christianity fought  religious wars  - called JIHADS and CRUSADES for hundreds of years   to establish their supremacy,   imperialis,  exclusivism,  colonialism,  invasions, conquests ,    colonizations, conversions , subjugation, enslaving the  converted  people  ( by fear, force,  terror)  and rule.   INDIA was   under JIHADIST   and  crusader rule  for 1000 yrs.

How did they   expanded  and spread  in INDIA ?     why are they converting   using all  resources , men, money   and  fraud ??<br>Islam  and   christianity are not  minority   religions in the world.  Christianity and  Islam are  Majority   ---religions  in the world.    Islam has  no idea of minority  - in their    religion .

Jai shree ram I also agree Inko jaankari ki kami h aur adhyaayan krna chahiye isko In the Old Testament:<br><br>Let us look at\\xa0Deuteronomy 13:6-9\\xa0&quot;If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying:\\xa0Let us go and worship other gods\\xa0(gods that neither you nor your fathers have known, gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other, or gods of other religions), do not yield to him or listen to him.\\xa0Show him no pity.\\xa0Do not spare him or shield him.\\xa0You must certainly put him to death.\\xa0Your hand must be the first in putting him to death, and then the hands of all the people.&quot;<br><br>Also let us look at\\xa0Deuteronomy 17:3-5\\xa0&quot;And he should go and worship other gods and bow down to them or to the sun or the moon or all the army of the heavens, .....and you must stone such one with stones and such one must die.&quot;<br><br>This verse was sent to me by\\xa0Yusif 65; may Allah Almighty always be pleased with him:\\xa0\\xa02 Chronicles <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=15m13s\">15:13</a>\\xa0&quot;All who would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel,\\xa0were to be put to death,\\xa0whether small or great, man or woman.&quot;<br><br>\\xa0\\xa0<br><br>In the New Testament by Jesus and Paul:<br><br>Jesus:<br><br>Note:\\xa0 Please pay close attention to my\\xa0red emphasis\\xa0below.<br><br>Let us look at what Jesus said in the New Testament\\xa0in context:<br><br>Matthew 15:1-9<br>1 Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,\\xa0<br>2 &quot;Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don&#39;t wash their hands before they eat!&quot;\\xa0<br>3 Jesus replied, &quot;And why do you break the command of God\\xa0for the sake of your tradition?\\xa0<br>4 For God said, &#39;Honor your father and mother&#39; and\\xa0&#39;Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.&#39;\\xa0<br>5 But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, &#39;Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,&#39;\\xa0<br>6 he is not to &#39;honor his father&#39; with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.\\xa0<br>7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:<br>8 &quot; &#39;These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.\\xa0<br>9 They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.&#39;&quot; Good understanding of malaise that is Islam &amp; Christianity, also of Hinduism viz. <br><br>अहिंसा परमो धर्मों,<br>धर्म हिंसा तथैवच।।<br><br>Also of issues facing the country and the anti-Hindu narrative set by the Breaking India forces and their cohorts.

B*** please !! i think that this kind of ideas is extrimisme it bring instability to any society and stop  the devlopement of nations it means make a civil war between different comunities in one country there is no pure race or a nation with one culture and identity and history proof that any nation traying the purification will despear (nazy, fashists exct) but when the tolerance existe between the comunities  it will be a stability remember that the first condition of the devlopment of a nation is the  social stability wich bring the political stability i m sur that who spread this kind of ideas want not good or peace for india i always though that india is the symbol of wisdoom but when i see this i m surprised where is your intellectuals? sociologues theologues  eliths in order to find solutions stop the hate between the same people  there is a serious problem , in an other hand i want just say i m a muslim from algeria we can&#39;t judge a whole religion any religion islam christanity hindu or any other religion  for the bad actions of some people belonging tothis religion in my part my country was colonised by christians they do all naugthety things wich you can&#39;t imagine but i never judge christianity i made my own researche about this region and find it peaceful and im sur that all the morals in the word preaching for the good but the poelpe only don&#39;t understand or make themselfs like that because it didn&#39;t touch their aims or their greed for the hindu i don&#39;t know what is the kind of problem u have with pakistan but pakistan is not islam and i m sur that if the rigth is with india god is with india because in islam the alone thing wich he denie to himself and his creatures is the unjustice in coran  if a muslim nation mistreat or macka agression in a nonmuslim nation god will help the nonmuslim nation because the rigth is in its side This guy is cool.Liked him. can&#39;t say anything about Christianity,but Islam is  indeed a religion of terrorism That&#39;s Why our country is globally ranked 4th in Communal voilence. The man&#39;s views are based solely on his grievance from his past...A single incident can and should never change a person&#39;s perspective of the whole wide world and all the religions it harbors...And these interviews are pointless since the person being interviewed almost always will state only those incidents in which he(or whatever he represents) has been victimised, skipping those where the reverse had happened! RSS wali soch hai jo bachpan se batayi ja rahi hai Well said This man is telling total lie about Quran verses Hinduism is becoming Abrahamic and Monotheistic. The  guy is perfectly right. Jai hindutva he&#39;s dumbfuck. ...n  a hypocrite Need more people like him.. thanks krishna.. totally foolish vedio Amazing Hindu! Christianity almost kiled my culture and history, the christians burned our holy tempels down and our religion before christianity was alote like the Hindu religion we had many Gods and everyman had a place, so become farmers and fishermans other become priests and some where teachers who knew French the lower class become Vikings and the vikings brought hell over anglo saxons and vikings invaded Kyev where they killed all muslims and it was a Kievan man with norwegian blood who become the first russian tsar so Russia she comes from us the scandinavian people and we want US to stop the war no brother war we have done to much of that nonsens and Indian hindus you are always welcomed in Europe as friends, allies and you are the only non white people who loves us and you have our love in return <br><br>Hail victory Hail Shiva and Hail Odin king of Walhalla where the brave may live forever. what the hell is going on FUCK this RSS puppet he is just trying to make a fake image of Islam he is not an Indian he doesn&#39;t know that what is ISLAM the religion of peace . Contastine didnt write the bible. Bible was written mainly by Paul, john, act, jeremaih, isiah, mathew etc. Its a composition of many writers in stretched of more thn 3000 yrs by prophets and jesus&#39; apostals. bas video mat bnao kuch bhi bol ke na is lodu ko hindu ya punjabi ka pta hai.  paise diye isko bhi 10rs aur isko lagta hai police paise leti hi . Well said Go see what&#39;s happening with Hindu , sikh and Cristian and Bhuddhist in muslim world . Thanks for taking interview of one person and painted whole religion to it (Commenting before watching video). Ha bhai.. Sati ki pratha bahut hi mahila pradan thi.. Kya yaar?Kya dimaag hain dekho..lol Juz give answers for these few questions who ever thinks he/she is true Hindu or Hindu nationalist <br>1)if intolerance came after the start of Islam and Christianity what would u say about that Hindu religion which discriminate its own belongings on basis of caste and varna&#39;s<br>2)if Hindu religion considered women to be superior why didn&#39;t it allowed women&#39;s to get educated and work outside as men do until mahatma fule ,savitribai fule  and some other revolutionaries fought for women empowerment ,education and equality<br>3)why is it always a brahmin priest and pandits in temples and it still continued till now <br>4)why were some castes were not even allowed to enter the temple until B.R.Ambedkar  gave us equality as a fundamental right in constitution<br>There are many questions more to ask but till then try to answer these with logic At least he has portrayed the mindset of hindu ,RSS,BJP, RSS supported governments and even RSS running schools. Propaganda! <br>nonsense! Dear Libtards , can you give a single counter argument that you guys can you give against him ? If no verse in bible says how to punish a unbeliever then why were gallilio and other renesance scientists punished ? Liberal muslims that you are quoting are lying. It&#39;s called Al Taquia Ek bhi galat baat nai boli iss ne. hindu bure ni hote agr hote to hindusatn me muslim bdhte na pakistan ki trh dusri community km hoti jati bura kon h sbko pta h I&#39;m a Sikh and this guy sounds very reasonably to me.<br><br>I respect that is open with his views and this is a sign of manliness. He&#39;s a sincere person. <br><br>I don&#39;t think he is a fanatic or anything. No one should shame him for his opinion.<br><br>At the end of the day Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism were born on the subcontinent, while Islam and Christianity is foreign. Should never forget that. People think they can read a few Quran verses out of context or the Bible and then portray the image as negative smh religion is something that shows us the way to become a better human, a pure soul... it is not something to fight over<br>all religion speaks in one language ... LOVE Devi puja krne wale log rape karre dusre religion ka nam leke  shame !!! Kuch b bolna hai aise gwaro ka interview Kon leta h At least for once can u please stop talking about somebody&#39;s religion. We wouldn&#39;t have half the problems we have today. 67 years until 2014 <br>A secular India why thinking shit now. Whenever some  Sanghi or a Maulana or a priest talks about some other religion. As an Indian u should say, their religion is none of our business. When some <b>****</b> talks about religion have the guts to say that my religion is none of ur business. Why why why ?????? 67 years until 2014 no major problems but right now the BJP comes to power and all hell breaks loose.There&#39;s no more Indian nationalism, there a lot more hindu nationalism and new organisations springing up that none has ever heard of before. At least for a week stop bothering about religion and you&#39;ll see the real change.<br>Shame on India, officially entered the book for religious tensions. Wonderfuljob RSS you are the Taliban of India coz this is exactly how the Taliban began in Pakistan. &quot;If your own brother doesn&#39;t believe in Christianity , then stone him to death&quot;. How will you find so much weed to stone entire nations In the end religion is the root of all evil.....🙂 bitter truth I&#39;m a Muslim. Abhi isee waqt challenge karta hu my sabse. Jaao jakar dekho jo ye ayath bataya wo sahi hy kya? Jung me jo log musalmaano ko maarne aarahe the unko maarkar apni jaan bachane ki baat hy Qur&#39;an me. Is ayath ko ye log tod marodkar dikhaate hain. Crazy uneducated person just shut the f**k up<br>little knowledge is a dangerous thing Humanity is alive due to dharmic religions i.e. Hinduism, Sikhhism, Jainism, Buddhism. Look like video maker is against Hinduism  ... the way he is giving reply by typing dear sir ,<br>no where in QURAN its written wt you said.<br>please dont make wrong allegations .<br>its written ,&quot; if KAFIR is not letting you to follow your religion, then fight against them &quot;. You think this guy is a nationalist or a fundamentalist? just ask any muslim if he would give up his own country&#39;s constitution for sharia law. I disagree with this guy on his view on Christianity because he is unaware of the fact that Christianity has adopted newer versions with newer times. Islam on the other hand did not. They are still following the rudimentary version of the texts which are more than obsolete in the modern society. This person is  talking absolutely  Truth ...   .He  has  guts to  speak  truth ,  salute to you  bro . it says kill non Muslim if they harm you  why you tell half verse of Quran Jai Modi Sarkar Rape culture was brought to India by Muslims????  OK so why kathua unauo rape accused and also nirbhaya case assumed are Hindus ???? Kuch bhi bole ke logo ko bharkado <br>Rss should be banned! Dislikes are not for the man, they are for the title. It should be &#39;Heart of a Hindu Nationalist&#39; Defaming hindus on lead eh The Diplomat ? Just saying this ........ if this person was not educated in a rss run school I bet his thinking would be drastically different ..... He was brain washed by rss<br>I&#39;m against rss but against not Hinduism This man doesn&#39;t know shit about anything and he is talking about Indian religion... And some of stupid ppl admiring him same on your self. Hindustani pehle bane, hindu, muslim, sikh, christian baadmein. A lot of problems would be solved. This man is showing the hipocracy of media. Proud to be Hindu nationalist this is what happens after people are brain washed and taught at very early age how others do so horrible things and what we do is absolute . this man is talking only one sided and has so less knowledge . this is what nationalists do ? no . they dont . this man isnt a nationalist . nationalists are people who love their country and protect its rights from inside  and out . and every religion muslims , christians , hindus , everyone of them have shed equal amount of blood in fighting for this country for freedom and since then to make it only better , this is man is only talking about religion . he is a brain washed atrocity in himself . he praises hindu leaders forgetting people like sir abdul kalam and maulana azad and many more . such a mindset will never lead to growth of any kind . and india my dear friend isnt just a country for hindus . its a country for diverse religions and always will be . i love every religion and respect everyones thoughts but is really hatred even going to provide us any meaningful solution ? because this man is filled with it and it can be seen in his eyes .  i dont have enemity with this man or his religion . I have enemity with such MINDSET . this man has clearly developed a one sided understanding which is very immoral and dumb . <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=03m50s\">03:50</a>  All countries have trouble with the muslims living there...

I am a Hindu. People like him are a disgrace to our culture. Aqbar politicians tha ? 😂😂😂 Hindustani&#39;s are great....... HINDU..... What this guy is saying that his forefathers were stupid and they taught him to be stupid and therefore he&#39;s stupid and he wants everyone else to be as stupid as he is. Aur ye jintni leftist aur qunit ndtv ki fauj Hai ye unhi ki karistani hai First of all what is the intention of this channel.Its intention is to prove India is highly intolerant country and their is unrest and the future is like <a href=\"http://syria.so/\">Syria.So</a> this person wants to trigger civil war in the country.The person to which this channel <a href=\"http://belongs.one/\">belongs.One</a> single person is not the idea of whole nation.If this person to whom the channel belongs tell people to which country he belongs then people can tell 1000 negative things about his country too.<br>Coming to the man in video,what he is saying about Quran is true but on Bible he is wrong.<br>But that doesn&#39;t mean there is unrest.<br>The owner of the channel is actually bastard. Half knowledge is dangerous knowledge! He claims Putin is anti Islam. Well for his information, Putin is the one who supports almost all of former USSR states which are now Islamic. Right from Ramzan Kadyrov of Chechnya to Kyrgyz or Uzbek or Tajik stateheads are all Putin supported. Also that Putin supports Iran and Syria, hell for that matter Putin doesn’t get along well with Christian states such as Ukraine and Georgia! Fukrey information rakhte hain yeh bhaisahab Sir firstly no where in the Bible it is written stone to death a non believer, in fact Jesus saves Mary of Magdalene from being stoned to death because she had committed adultery. I will not say anything about Islam because I have not read the holy Quran till now, but what I do know that this argument of nationalism, regionalism and religion is so stupid, let&#39;s say what if Americans start killing all Indians abroad, would you wage war on them, I guess no because there is a simple saying that every dog believes he is a lion in his den, wherever there is a majority, the minority will become a channel to vent frustration and anger of our miserable lives. However my opinion is such that it&#39;s human, to behave this way, to blame others for our misgivings, target the weak, survival of the fittest, just like nature&#39;s laws, but if we really consider ourselves different, smart, reasonable and intelligent as compared to other species then forget your animalistic ways, give in to reason, not everyone is good and nor everyone is bad. let us grow in peace, consciousness and reason and help others grow. Spread love not hate. Gau raksha k naam per kisi Muslim ko marne ko ye sahi bata raha h.<br>Usi maa k maas ko jab export karte h tab is ko dard ni hota,<br>Maa ka doodh piya h to beef export band kr k bata, My opinion...RUBBBBBISH<br>You talk of your religion even you don&#39;t understand..but be carefull when talk about islaam even you understand.<br>Jai hind BJP BULLSHIT Wah re wah, bhai pahli puri ayat padhle aadhi adhuri baat karke logon ko gumrah karna band kar. full of shit Bloody reporter.

Chutiya quint gud one U shud hv also made a comparative view of a person brought up in a madrassa and publish the views.

Ye maa ka lauda pagal hogaya Make sure you come to our country next time - you will go back without your head He is right. bht chutiya insanhai ye India is ranked 4th in the number of religious unrests. Fine. But that&#39;s not just because of Hindu nationalists. It&#39;s also because of the intolerance in the Muslim community in India. I believe that &#39;Hindu&#39; extremism and nationalism are the results of the Islamic extremism. Both need to be addressed. Anyone who has read essays by Dr B R Ambedkar on Hindus and untouchability will learn that beef was a much-coveted food in India much before Islam was even founded and that the recent politics around beef — though overtly aimed at the Muslim minority — is in fact covertly targeting Dalits and farmers.<br>How many Indians actually eat beef? According to one estimate — apart from tribals, Muslims, Christians and Dalits — a whopping 40 per cent of Hindus eat beef. While beef is the cheapest form of nutrition for the poor, the rich love juicy steaks. Why then this myth of the holy cow?<br>Everyone knows that when the Aryans wandered into these parts, they were a nomadic tribe dependant on their cattle wealth. Therefore, Aryan tribal leaders were called ‘gopatis’ (owners of cattle) and their daughters as ‘duhitr’ (one who milks!). What did the Aryans do when their cows stopped milching and the oxen got too old? They simply killed them in various rituals and enjoyed the meat!<br>The gods that the Aryans brought along with them — such as Indra, Agni and Soma — loved cow meat and liquor so much that it was regularly offered to them. The Rgveda (created some time during 1500-1200 BC) says that during the ‘ashvamedha’ ritual which was conducted by kings involved sacrificing cows. Ditto for other yagnas such as ‘rajasuya’ and ‘vajapeya’. It also says that when esteemed guests pay a visit or a marriage ceremony is held, serving beef is the duty of the host. The Rgveda sometimes refers to guests as ‘goghna’ meaning one who leads to the slaughter of a cow.<br>Cattle was so much a part of life in those times that the ‘Atharvaveda’ says, when the dead were being cremated, a bull was also burnt so that the departed person could hitch a ride to the other world.<br>Manu, who codified religious and social norms for the Hindus sometime around 200 BC — 200 AD, says camel meat is not to be eaten but beef is fine. He also says since animals were created to be sacrificed, eating their meat on special occasions is a divine rule. According to Manu, both the sacrificed and the sacrificer would be blessed with a higher status in the next life. Yajnavalkya, a highly respected sage who lived in Mithila around 100-300 AD, declared “I, for one, eat it, provided that it is tender.”<br>Even literary texts speak of various kinds of meat being eaten by all castes of people. Mahabharatha — composed in 8th or 9th century BC — mentions that when the Pandavas were banished into the forests, they, a la Salman Khan, killed all kinds of wildlife for food. At one point of time, Draupadi offers Jayadratha and his retinue loads of deer meat. The epic also praises a king called Rantideva, in whose kitchen two thousand cows were butchered every day.<br>Valmiki’s Ramayana is not far behind when it comes to beef. Having its origin sometime in 5th century BC, Ramayana speaks of animal sacrifice as a means to propitiate gods. Not only was Rama born after his father Dasharatha conducted elaborate rituals involving the sacrifice of animals declared as edible in the shastras, when Sita is being ferried across the Ganga and Yamuna, she promised to offer loads of cow meat and liquor to the rivers upon successful completion of exile. Not just literary texts, even medicinal theories of ages past, recommend meat as cures. Caraka Samhita says beef stew is good for intermittent fevers, while Susruta Samhita maintains that beef is not only holy but also good to get rid of fever, cough and other such ailments.<br>Chanakya, who ensured the rise of the great Mauryan empire, did not consider the cow as holy in his famous treatise ‘Arthashastra’. Ashoka the Great, who pioneered PETA’s concerns in third century BC, significantly, did not ban the slaughter of cows.<br>The first one to oppose slaughter of animals as part of rituals was Buddha. Though he propounded the principle of ‘Ahimsa’, Buddha did not support vegetarianism. Some historians believe that Bud-dha died because he ate pork which had gone bad. For many centuries after Buddha, bikkus, who depended on the largesse of the common people, ate all kinds of meat that was offered to them. They had no option since they were trying to propagate their religion in a land where most people were beef eaters. Rejoinder<br>Rigveda, Manusmiriti sanction beef-eating<br><br>A recent photograph of some Hindu protesters demanding a ban on non-vegetarian food in restaurants and government canteens in India made me sit up and take notice. I believe that these protesters are ignorant of what their religion preaches. They are simply going against their own religious scriptures.\\xa0<br><br>Most of the world religions sanctify offering of animals in sacrifice including Hinduism. Hindu scriptures are witnesses to such sacrifices and killings of animals for consumption. References of such commands are replete in Hindu scriptures like Manusmriti, Vedas, Upanishads, Brahmins, Grihsutras, Dharmasutras and others.<br><br>This column would not suffice for quoting all such references but a few from different scriptures are imperative to bring home the point and clear the misconceptions:<br>Manusmriti (Chapter 5 / Verse 30) says, “It is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals, for Brahma has created both the eaters and the eatables.”\\xa0<br><br>Manusmriti (5 / 35) states: When a man who is properly engaged in a ritual does not eat meat, after his death he will become a sacrificial animal during twenty-one rebirths.\\xa0<br><br>Maharishi Yagyavalkya says in Shatpath Brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, “I eat beef because it is very soft and delicious.”\\xa0<br>Apastamb Grihsutram (1/3/10) says, “The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage.”\\xa0<br>Rigveda (10/85/13) declares, “On the occasion of a girl’s marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered.”\\xa0<br>Rigveda (6/17/1) states that “Indra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo.”\\xa0<br>Vashistha Dharmasutra (11/34) writes, “If a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ‘Shraddha’ or worship, he goes to hell.”<br><br>Also, comments of some great scholars of Hinduism are also worth noting:<br>· Hinduism’s greatest propagator Swami Vivekanand said thus: “You will be surprised to know that according to ancient Hindu rites and rituals, a man cannot be a good Hindu who does not eat beef”. (The Complete Works of Swami Vivekanand, vol.3, p. 536).<br>· Mukandilal writes in his book ‘Cow Slaughter – Horns of a Dilemma’, page 18: “In ancient India, cow-slaughter was considered auspicious on the occasions of some ceremonies. Bride and groom used to sit on the hide of a red ox in front of the ‘Vedi’ (alter).”<br>· A renowned scholar of scriptures Dr. Pandurang Vaman Kane says, “Bajsancyi Samhita sanctifies beef-eating because of its purity”. (Dharmashastra Vichar Marathi, page 180)<br>· Adi Shankaracharya’ commentary on Brihdaranyakopanishad 6/4/18 says : ‘Odan’ (rice) mixed with meat is called ‘Mansodan’. On being asked whose meat it should be, he answers ‘Uksha’. ‘Uksha’ is used for an ox, which is capable to produce semen.<br>· The book ‘The History and Culture of the Indian People’, published by Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan, Bombay and edited by renowned historian R.C.Majumdar (Vol.2, page 578) says: “this is said in the Mahabharat that King Rantidev used to kill two thousand other animals in addition to two thousand cows daily in order to give their meat in charity”.<br><br>It seems a great majority of the followers of Hinduism are not in contact with their religious scriptures thus falling an easy prey to the fascist forces like the Sangh Parivar who have nothing to offer to the Indian society save hatred. And all Indians know where these hatred-mongers are taking India to? He is right,,, RSS rocks.. 💪💪💪🔫🔫 Oh hooo personally call ho rahi hai,  😱😱😱😱😱😱  desh tarakii ki rah Parh chal raha hai 😡😡😡.

This is absolutely nonsense. Yes we are proud of bring Hindu and being a nationalist. We believe in harmony and peace. But this video wants to malign Hindus. Shame !!! Seriously ?? I mean this is ur journalism...Wow...  Tell me 1 thing that this guy said was wrong.. Don&#39;t you think appeasement does happen in India ?? Why do Majority Hindus are denied previleges.? Why doesn&#39;t murder of a Hindu boy or rape of Hindu girl becomes a sensational issue ? Why Kashmir pandits had to leave and nobody have a damn ?? Why singing and standing up for our national antem is considered bad in a country like us ?? Why is a Hindu labelled as communal when he proudly says I am a Hindu an I am a nationalist ?? Why is universal law for Hindus and a special and separate law board for Muslims who pledge their loyalty 1st to Quran and later to our Constitution ?? Is it not the fact that our nation progressed and infrastructure developed at a faster rate when their was a right wing gov at centre ? Is it not the fact that we became self reliant and a nuclear state during a right wing gov ? Is it not the fact pseudo secular parties opposed India being a nuclear power ?  And above all ..The most important question... Is being tolerant  considered duty of Hindus only and other religions can wage battles and riots just because they are minorities??  Where are we heading actually ??.. this video is just a propaganda expansion for maligning the nationalist and Hindus. A Hindu will always be a nationalist. You like it or not. Just like you ppl like you will always be cowards and pseudo secular who don&#39;t want to face the reality. Bai tu phle neech cast kho tumare Mandir mai allow nhi karta te , paani tuk Pilate.

Quickly Sahi hai sahab truth.. Kya hai yaar ye 😤😤😤😤😤 Or jo bjp ke leaders ke supporters nahi hai unka kya?😤😤 Another case of an intelligent person being manipulated by religion. Jaha pe yeh likha hai QURAN mein ki kafiru ko maaro uss ki agli line b padna bhootni ke...abhe thuje kya bolu RSS ka pada likha hai tu <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m24s\">2:24</a> does not take much to substantiate such claims. <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+13%3A6-10&amp;version=NIV\">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+13%3A6-10&amp;version=NIV</a> <br><br>Deuteronomy 13:6-10 The Book of Deuteronomy is the fifth book of the Torah and the Christian Old Testament. All these so called religious nationalists(every religion) should be taken to a psychiatrist..there religion teaches peace and they speak againt other religions..thats the truth..better come out of all this..give these people education and jobs so they are busy in their own life and not doing riots in the name of their Gods..(wonder if any god, eg. Ram.. wanted muslims to die..bcoz both are the kids of same god..) so stop fighting on religion and work for peace and prosperity as one nation.. and this person  is telling eve teasing and such issues came from islam ....well seeing  u it doesnt feel like u r  1200 or 1300 years old or neither u were born during the orgin of hinduism or islam . then how do you such awfull things came from Islam. its the man which created it nor god neither religion. islam mein  women ki importance bahut zayada <a href=\"http://hai.it/\">hai.it</a> is even said heaven lies under the feet of women ,and who said girls arnt  given rytes ...its just they are asked to cover themselves and dresses modestly that doesnt mean  that they arent given rytes. according to me no religion teaches bad and negativity its human who find and create negative things and name them as <a href=\"http://religion.in/\">religion.in</a> muslims those uneducated illiterates are terrorist . and in hindus they are peolpe like u. Chutiya log chutiye jesi soch Christian&#39;s are corrupt people.......as their conversation is based on jobs,money,etc...... I agree with only one thing that he said. Ghandhivadis are as good a cows who cannot resist slaughter. If there is one person to be blamed for the pathetic condition of this country, Its Gandhi. Glad he was shot. Not 1 but 3 times, so he doesn&#39;t live to ruin the country anymore. But still, he left Nehru to ruin the country. We realized that when We lost Todays PoK to Pakistan. The great leader who refused the Security Council seat for India and suggesting to give it to China. Now China is stopping India from getting a Security council seat. So according to him after Islam, the women were suppressed etc. How about sati ? You joker you never respected women in your religion. Thanks to this guy that he didn&#39;t blame islam for creating casts in hinduism. According to graph and the video  maker they want to said every riots happen due to Mind of a Hindu Nationalist , Great report is only one sided no include of a Muslim community member with  non secular thinking. Deuteronomy 13:6-9 &quot;If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying: Let us go and worship other gods (gods that neither you nor your fathers have known, gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other, or gods of other religions), do not yield to him or listen to him. Show him no pity. Do not spare him or shield him. You must certainly put him to death. Your hand must be the first in putting him to death, and then the hands of all the people.&quot; <br><br>So much for &quot;Unsubstantiated&quot; claim. what you know about islam ? you are zero. islam is the religion for peace Bc sati pratha kha see aayi I am proud to be an atheist .I only believe in Humanity...And no other religion.All the misery on Earth had happened for Religions...Every religion thinks that it is superior than others. Konsa nasha kiya h bhai ne Yeh toh pakka hinduwaadi lagta hai, har baat Koh kisi nah kisi tarah sai doosreh dharam pey fair raha hai. Aab aise aadmi ko kuch kisi baat poochni hai toh, Kya yeh aadmi kuch aur bolega. Mere hisab seh harr dharam/mazabh apne apne usuloon ke hisabh seh sahi hai. Par dukh tab hota hai, jab kuch zulm ya kaand ya samasya suljhaane mein jab hum ek doosre ki taang kheechne lagte hai aur burai. Abh, jaise bolah Gaya ki girls education ki samasya Islam se shuru hui, par Kya aap iska jawaab dey saktein hain ki Hindu&#39;s literacy rate is least in the world karke 2016 survey mein kyun bataya Gaya tha. Main kisi seh koi gilah ya shikwe nahin karna ya karwaana chahta aur nah toh kisi ek mazhab/dharam ko favour karna chahta hoon. Bas hame Insaaniyat koh ek dharm samajh ke sabhi ke saath ek shaanti rakhni chahiyeh aut doosroon ke dharam ko izzat deyni chahiyeh. can&#39;t disagree with him...islam instigates..then hinduism reacts.., unfortunately hindusim takes all the blame. Extraordinary<br>This is the right form of attending to injustice<br>Going into minds of the concerned the one writing on the top is unsustainable .....for sure Pehle Holy Bible padh phir comment kar. Tujhe khud nai pata h k tu kya bol raha h ! comment section is bigger bullshit than video We are united as Indians but divided by the religious leaders, political parties,etc. Only for a sole reason  i.e  for using divide and rule policy.<br><br>I am a Muslim, the ninth chapter of the holy Quran is initially based on the commands the all mighty gives the Muslims before the war.<br><br>War: The king of Mecca (an idol worshiper) wanted to end Islam by killing the profet and so the king marched an army towards Madina.<br><br>Allah commanded all the Muslims to defend Islam in this war.<br><br>Orders: Allah ordered the Muslims to slay every idol worshiper in the battle field but if they were ready to follow the instructions of Allah then the Muslims mustn&#39;t hurt them but rather ensure that they reach to a safe location. Sub jhoot hai yeh verses PuRe Nahi Bata Raha hai.Full Quran padho Aur PuRe context Ko padho tab samjah aeyga SUPERB VIDEO....ALL TRUTH... crime has no Religion I don&#39;t agree with his views.Not even one bit. But I can tell this channel is trying so hard to vilify him. U believe him or not he is so right on many issues.. The end result of not getting H1B visa and cant afford house in Dubai. He thinks India imports oil from Nepal. This is rapist BJP logic and RSS anal sex attitude. I reported this video spreading terrorism and voilence between different region also showing wrong image of my country In 2030 either Hindus will be minority or united .

Saare musaaal maan gaddar hain, ye kaise santi ka paigam de sakte hain, jo secular banneki dikhawa kar rahe hain unhe sochna chahiye... i dont think Hindus are that bad. I am no Indian, but i know Hindus are very generous and lovely people can&#39;t judge the whole religion on one person&#39;s opinion Stop this bullshit you idiot, tere wajah se hi alag alag dharmo me ladai hoti hai. Tum jaise log kabhi aman aur chain nahi aane denge. Idiot jo history me past me hua usko lekar baithe rhenge to humesha ladaiya hi hongi. बदबूदार हिंदूवादी छक्कों की गांड फट गई इसको देख कर XD<br>जब लंड-कटे गधे की तरह रेंकने से काम नहीं बना, तो सारे नीचे comments में आकर रंडियों की तरह रो रहे हैं lol<br><br>धर्म के नाम पर छाती पीट-पीट कर चिल्लाते फिरते हैं, लेकिन जब सेना में जाने की बात आती है तो गांड फट जाती है और दुम दबाकर घर भाग जाते हैं...और फिर निर्दोष लड़कियों को Valentines Day पर पीटते और बलात्कार कर के खुद की बहादुरी का गान हकलाते हैं। दाढ़ी बढ़ाकर, टीका लगाकर खुद को महान समझने लगते हैं, लेकिन बाद में सदैव डरपोक और अनपढ़ निकलते हैं।<br><br>और जब इनके झूठ को सामने लाया जाए, तो धोती में गुस्से के मारे हग देते हैं और गालियाँ भौंकने लगते हैं। कितने टट्टी लोग हैं ये।<br><br>Lol, सच्चे हिंदू हो तो सभी धर्मों की रक्षा करो और सबका सम्मान करो, एक नपुंसक भड़वे की तरह रोते और हत्या करते रहोगे तो हिंदू कहलाने के लायक नहीं बन पाओगे। A big load of bullshit coming in the viewer&#39;s way. Beware! Nhi galat bhai joot sirf joot I like this man. He has got a point. If u are a educated person nd love humanity than don’t read the comments.. 🙃 The video potrays an heavy misinterpretation of the term &#39;extremists&#39; . This man had some minute  objectable views which are not even comparable to the views of a religious extremists but portraying him in such a manner dismantles even the structure of term used . A misleading and falsified video . This man don&#39;t know about islam and speaking rubbish because he is mentally disturbed and by the environment BTW each and every person irrespective of their religion is a Hindu whether he/she is Muslim or a Christian or Sikh or Jain etc Hinduism is just a misnomer actual name of this religion is vedic dharma or sanatana dharma He is saying that he is not against Muslim&#39;s but @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m17s\">6:17</a> he says he doesn&#39;t find anything wrong about beating Muslim&#39;s such a racist People needed to be educated very very well about each and every religion. They need to know the real meaning of their religion&#39;s   holy book Religion doesn&#39;t kill people <br>People kill people<br>People commit crimes <br>People should be taught to value life not a fictional character called God ek baat jo mujhe is video me acchi lagi vo ye thi ki is bande ne ek jgah sach bola, aur vo ye ki ye jo caste/religion based hate hai ye inke ancestors ne inhe sikhayi hai aur yahi ye apne bachcho ko bhi sikhayege, matlb pidiya andh bhakt rahi hai, hm bhi hai aur aane vali naslo ko bhi andh bhakt bnayege. Wow this guy doesn&#39;t know about anything. Bro you are not Hindu. He forgot to mention Manuwad, others points are fair. Did anyone see a graph in the middle about religious violence and it placed Afghanistan and Pakistan below India. Just 3 months ago, some 60 people were killed in Afghanistan by Islamic bombers. Over 70000 people lost their lives in Pakistan in the last few years owing to Islamic terrorism. And they place India above these countries. It&#39;s hilarious how the west view things. There were so many instances of racism and violence in UK Germany etc but they are on top First they divided us by borders, now they have divided us by religion. 79.8% out of 100% are scared, irony Where did this guy learned Quran? From ISIS.. such a fucktard... He might be right on most of the points but not about the verses of Quran... Please reachout to any Islamic scholar and ask about this verse and he shall explain you in detailed manner This choo...ya saying wrong Putin and angela they don&#39;t have any problem with Muslims..he is totally wrong...this is real face of R.S.S...totally propaganda...against minorities. mujhy hindu se nahi muhjy hinduism se problem Nxt Modi uncle who want&#39;s to trick us by his sweet words(all  lies) plZ stop diving our country. Abey beedi maar paan khaa Tu bus apna tatti gyaan mat de Rss k school m pda h to yehi thinking hogi aur kya expect kr skte h He is a big liar one of the balaathkari janta party follower..And he has no idea about islam ye rss ka paid campaign band karo , reporter ke naam per dhabbe ho tum My goodness, BJP bs apne  bando ka sunti hai ..Ab to bjp follower khud h hathiyar uthane lage hai a.. aur police kuch ni kr ri hai looking for political mileage and this is shit by uneducated people It is his perspective of seeing things.. not his fault, may be he is dealt with something in his past which instigated outrage towards other communities, or brainwashed.May be  he is partially true but people need to understand that bible quraan or  geeta are secondary things.. humanity always comes first and killing someone in the name of religion would be a shame on humanity.. Hindu violence nai Kate h?<br>Kav koe movie ka naam pe kav religion&#39;s kav politics This man.. He is 200% right. This  is interview is totally scripted   and this man is totally  sell out. Why are you putting &quot;unsubstantiated claim&quot; when the guy is clearly right! @The diplomat: do your homework. Seriously nowadays idiots are in charge of journalism. Amazing!! I did some fact checking on what that guys said . I did find a verse from bible Deuteronomy 13:6-10<br><br>&quot;&quot;If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you ... Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die.&quot; -- Dt.13:6-10&quot;<br><br>@the Diplomat: You clearly suck big time. Maybe even hell will throw you out for what you stand for! Recognize the entire human race as one.<br>- Guru Gobind Singh<br><br>Now, the Merciful Lord has issued His Command.<br>Let no one chase after and attack anyone else.<br>Let all abide in peace, under this Benevolent Rule. ||13||<br>- Guru Granth Sahib 74 fuck u if u dnt knw bible pls dnt say..nethng dt  comes frm ur mind Dont scroll comment section for spicy comments <br>...😂😂😂😂😂😂 B.C why do you have problem with Hindus? <br>And what about 80-90% Muslims are Islam fundamentalist and nationalists.<br>And that percentage among hindus is only 5-10%. You have problem with 5-10% and not with those 80-90%s I respect his opinion as a common man of India but he absolutely does not know about Islam or Christianity. Looks like what he knows is what he &#39;heard&#39; about what these belief systems teach, which is quite common. I find it funny when so many people of different religion fight with each other because of their imaginary friend ...i mean their God...if all religions advocate peace then why the fuck every religious extremist is just a pure terrorist... Uneducated. You were wrong about female sexual exploitation, in karna&#39;s kingdom, there was open sale of female teenager for sexual relationship! Dear if you don&#39;t know christianity.. Then you don&#39;t have the right to say anything..<br><br>You don&#39;t know how you had got freedom,Gandhiji&#39;s technique to give us freedom was nothing but from the bible... Ladkiyo ko pareshan karna tumhare book mahabharat mein hee hai.. <br><br>Religion ko pehchan na aapko nai aata... Aur ladkiya ko kyun kam darja diya jata hai wo kabhi kuran ya bible ka old testament padh lena... Jab injustice hota hai ladies ke sath tab bat sahi hai aapki.. But jese aap apne religeon mein hone wali pagalpanti bandh nai karenge tab tak aapko kuchh nai pata ki religion kya hota hai JAI HINDU SANATANA DHARMAM Chutia lol hahahaha. Still lives in dark ages. please mention the scholars name when you guys are using references in subtitles He saying truth the world is a stupid place.... devi ki pujne wale ek rapist ko jammu me bacha rahe hain Thankyouuuu !!! The man told the truth about whyyy the rape and teasement cases are high in India. It&#39;s the infected part of Islam<br> that India is suffering with. <br>There was never a wife beating case , Women had 12-50 men in line and she decided who to marry , no dowery cases before the Infection. But now every country where Muslims are more than 6% these things are happening . Shame that others are too afraid to speak the truth I agree with him !!! Reading all these comments here is making me laugh. Almost every &quot;claim&quot; he made was false and maybe taught to him by his RSS backed pseudo-knowledged institutions. No wonder Rural areas still think education is pointless.<br>His Opening statement was so stupid. Did all Mahabarat wars about good vs evil happen after Islam and christianity? Don&#39;t be ridiculous. &quot;Kadwa sach&quot; my foot. lol Kya bola go mans kya hindu nhi khate sale bat krte he It&#39;s not written in bible. Hinduism only india . Isla middle east africa euorpe south asia and far east . <br>They think that fighting pakistan would end Islam these idiots are wrong buf if india is destroyed forget about hinduism in the world He thinks he is saying truth. Let me give all of u what is truth. Every religion has roots of their violence . even the mahabharta was a massacre. Lord shiva fought Lord Vishnu. Lord Shiva slayed Ganesha&#39;s head. And there numerous stories which I believe is real and are subject to violence. Every religion is violent. Yes Hinduism different from other religions becoz it presents various kinds of knowledge which are not included in other religions. But do you think God gave this knowledge. Absolutely no. Every religion is fake. They were not gods, they were advanced civilization from other place. Now, the truth hurts. Tu pura pagal h . Jeher kitta hai bhai tere dimaag me.. jitna zyada zulm karoge aap india me utna hi jaldi aap log khatam ho jaaoge.    koi nahi rok sakta.   chahe jitna bhi zulm karo.    aur jitne bhi chize isne kahi islam ke khilaf woh koi bhi muslim aasani se bata sakta hai ki sach kya hai.   ap logo ne hi insano me bhedbhav paida kiya hai.   aphi logo ne betiyo ko mara hai.  aphi ne dahej pratha shuri kiya hai.   aphi logo ne helpless logo ko pith pe vaar kiya hai.   aurto bachho budho pe julm karne wali kaum ho aap log.    jitna bhi ap tadaplo.  kuch nahi hoga.   aap logo ne chingari lagayi hai zulm karke.  ab aag aap hi ke gharo me lagegi.  bhagwan ki marzi se He is suffering from Muslimphobia. Pura ka pura script rataa hua lag raha hai Hindu ko badnaam karne ke liye banaya hai ye video I dare anyone stopping me from eating beef I will kick their sorry ass Great video......unveiled the minds. Poor brainwashed man Hindustan me hindu hain to sukhi ho warna dekh lo duniya ka haal aur in channelo ke chakkar me mat padna warna libya aur syria banne me time nai lagega. Aur yeh sab actors hain jyada jasbaati na bano. bold article <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=7m03s\">7:03</a> +The Diplomat you say that most scholars disbelieve that mahabharat portrays a matriarchal society.....then you have either not read mahabharat at all or you have spoken to those who haven&#39;t and are self proclaimed scholars............Here are some facts for you to consider.. Mahabharat starts with the story of king shantanu(bhishma&#39;s father) who married Satyavati after mother Ganga gave Shantanu a child(Bhishma and took him with her to raise him). When Bhishma returned, satyavati became angry and jealous that the kingdom will go to Bhishma who respected her regardless and took an oath of celibacy and renounced the kingdom to serve as a steward. From there after king shantanu&#39;s death the whole kingdom was under her control( as her son Vichitravirya died sometime soon after his crowning). Even after Satyavati&#39;s grandchildren resumed the thone(pandu and dhritrashtra), the whole story is proof how Satyavati&#39;s words were the final law of the house. If this doesn&#39;t tell you how matriarchy and patriarchy weren&#39;t there but instead women were respected equally if not more, then you are biased and do irresponsible journalism Bakwaas mtt kro main bhi hindu hu aur nationalist bhi shudra, vashy bhi khshatriy bhi aur brahman bhi aur inmese hr shabd ka arth mujhe pta hai. Why do all these idiots need an imaginary thing to follow rules and live.? Just use commen sense.. spread love.. idiots Warning: Fundamentalists getting orgasm down below! i am an non religious man,,,i have a doubt ,wt if i see an another God after my death rather that the God i worshipped here on earth I totally agree with this man...his ideologies are pure practical He&#39;d wrong information about christianity,  most off the portion of stoned ull find in old testement ie b4 jesus christ and our lord jesus stop all the sacrifing, killing even stoning .. jesus  preach  love  and only love.  This Guy need to learn Gospel(new testement). people like this are a disgrace to the society, this guy lives accepting whatever bs his relatives pour into his ears, Propoganda at its best ! Christianity aur Islam agar itna hi bura hai toh puri duniya mein kaise fail gaya, hindutva kaise nahi faila ? And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter... and fight them until fitnah is no more, and religion is for Allah.<br><br>—\\u2009Quran <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m19s\">2:19</a>1<br><br>But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<br><br>\\u2009—\\u2009translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali<br><br>Quran is full of verses that force violence against the Polytheists, Atheists and Non-believers of Islam. I think you should take interview of ISIS  person and listen to thier views regarding other religions! Oops but u cant probably ull be killed while doing so😂😂 I fuckin like this dude😀😘...kudos... We hindus need people like you in the government .....so that these muslims will understand their rightful place in the society!....Live long and prosper BJP 🙏 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23RSS\">#RSS</a> Kya bakwas kr raha hai be chutiya Most of the things he speaks about Abrahamic religion are just plain facts. I feel very sorry for this poor man. Except under Hindu kings only other religions flourished, No other religions floursihed nor got as much as equality under other faith rulers.<br>Jews ,muslims,buddhists ,jains were all used to be treated equally, because of islamic fanaticism and muslims who voted for radical parties like jinnah was the reason pakistan formed. Even to this day there are some dangerous radical organisations in kashmir and also in kerala,West bengal which spread violence to kill Hindus. No news channell telecasts it, and biased medias like Quint,NDTV,Wire propogates hate on Hindus&amp;Hinduism to muslims and divide people over some single digit incidents done by some idiots naming it as hindutva, Later after enquiry it will be as some random fight for something and not based on faiths,&amp; then no one reports the correct story after misleading people in the first place. If Hinudus were like that islam followers,christianity followers,  no religion would have ever born in India. Hinduism by nature is secular which accepts other religions, No religions accepts other religions except Hinduism.<br>Problem in the world is Islam and christianity need to accept each other as religions and respect each other and dont grow hatred and vested agendas over each other. waah beta waah practice of sati islam ne khatm ki tmhari ..... zinda jala diya krte the bewa ko .... Get well soon. my number is 9898795828 if you dare come to interview or ask questions. i will amswer whatever you ask with a reason for my answer Hindu ekta zindabad 👍👍 Jai Sri Ram What are you trying to prove ?? That you are biased journalists .. you succeeded in proving it .. Chutya ke muh se gobar nikal rha.😂😂😂😂 WhatsApp university graduate! Why don&#39;t u show the interview without your unwanted comments,  we don&#39;t want your views we just want to see it as it is. The unsubstantiated claims as per the video have evidence according to historians. This is what you call brainwashed. It&#39;s not his fault, it&#39;s the poison filled in him by the media and politics. India needs to work here and learn from Pakistan. Pakistan has worked a lot in this regard creating respect for other religions in the hearts of people by using media, education and politics.  Pakistan is now getting better and better in this regard and as per new stats Pakistan is not in the list of top 10 intolerant states, which is a great news even in my locality a Sikh family lives and everyone respects them. According to me It all depends on the media and politics  otherwise humans tend to love and explore each other then to kill and irritate and humans are same everywhere so it&#39;s not a fault of India but the fault of its media and politics which potray minorities as bad for their own good and TRP. It&#39;s very interesting to see this (from a non nationalist perspective)... really shows how these people actually think. It&#39;s good to have these debates in the open, but in a proper academic context - like the annotations you added were very good. This just goes to show that many extremists are delusional to some extent. Bohot ghatiya thinking hai. Phele toh mujhe insaan baana doh uper wale bohot Hai I am a human first before being a Hindu, Muslim , Christian, Sikh.... <br>And people supporting such ideology are no better than this shit!!! <br>Good and bad are in every community! Islam is never imposed on any human.. All of them have make their independent choice to follow islam,  religion is in danger than teach your fellow show them real path instead of showing nangi talwar....  Read your vedas clearly &#39;no several god can be worshiped&#39; stone worship is also inhibited in your vedas read breifly about your so called snatani dharm plz gain knowledge not the ideolgy of some political party or some other disturbing elements they just show you the examples not the facts... Islam is all about peace and harmony,  the villages where muslims are there dalits are safe but see the conditions of dalits where no muslim are there they are living a horrible life... M not against hinduism or any religion.... This man have no knowledge of their own most of the thoughts are of false background but some where in some points he is right... Just see the facts why islam is growing faster after the enormous hatred study about it read it if something you get wrong then say <br>Read the quran and go through the meaning deeply on which condition quran ul kareem saying the main problem of this country is. Half knowledge... Admin we all know what is the motive to make this video. Don&#39;t  teach wrong things about hindusim. We all know his is correct He is correct The trade mark of unemployed librandu....Target hindus, beat Caste, blame everything on Modi and when facts arrive cry foul... This man doesn&#39;t know much about Islam and Christianity. So don&#39;t waste your time in listening to What he says about these two religions. I can understand his point and his mind set what is tought to him by his childhood and I don&#39;t want to argue with waht is real teaching of (Islam and Christianity) because he is totally unaware of it but I just want to ask him that sir plz tell me if you are a HINDU NATIONALIST then why you guys are so cruel to dalit Hindus and why their is not any dalit chief of RSS why are you guys are following the rules that are made by B R Ambedkar. You should rebel against it and should change the constitution of our county. And what about all that Hindus who is having a Muslim friend like I am having. A lot of Hindu friends. i am shocked to see the view of this guys but more shocked to see the comments in his support. why so much of hatred I spent 8 months in India.  The muslim, christian and buddhist areas were best.  I felt the hindus were often blinded in the same way white nationalists are in the west.  There are a lot of similarities between Modi and Trump.  Beware of thinking you are superior because of your culture.  There is much to admire in Indian culture but not nationalism. that guy is talking rationally and &quot;the india is 4th religiously violent country&quot; that is bogus and even muslims will agree to it. &quot;the diplomat&quot; is spreading hatred yaad rakhna hindu hai isiliye muslims ko itna % me rehne mila, world me jake cheak krlo koi non-islamic country me minority ki % population kya hai <br><br><br>hindu hai shaaant the tabhi toh babar akbar jaiso ne raaj kiya hai , lrkin kabtak ye hindu shant rahega , ajj bheef baan pe sawal uuthraha hai hindustan hai desh ka naam aur hindu ko rules baaananeh me dikkkat ho rahi hai &#39;&#39;<br><br><br>jaaagoooo hinduooo ab nahi jaagey  toh sayad ane wale samay me apni bahu betiyo ko bacha nai paaaogey , jara jake bhangladesh medekho hinuoo ke saath kya ho raha hai he is ileterate and manipulate Bilkul ek ek baat sahi bola Thik to bola.....nothing wrong. ..... Mind of a hindu nationalist is far better than a islamic follower Firstly, it is tragic that the an ideology that caused the Indian partition and bloodshed is being chosen as a foundation pillar in India. What any individual went through at the time of the partition is tragic. We should stay away from such hate, it just creates more hate. India choose to be secular where Pakistan chose to adopt &#39;one religion, one nation&#39; ideology and it is fairly evident what each has reaped. <br><br>Secondly, it is a travesty to now adopt on this side of the border such a right wing ideology, where it has reaped bloodshed, chaos and confusion. We should be learning something from history or we will be condemned to repeat it. Should more of us visit again the tragedies of segregation on religious grounds. Spill more blood and for what gain?<br><br>Thirdly, there is no historical basis that Christianity was created by Constantinople, this is a case of hersey where historical evidence proves not so.(<a href=\"http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/resource/InternetResources.xhtml)\">http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/resource/InternetResources.xhtml)</a><br><br>Fourthly, there is no chapter or verse in the Christian Faith that tells Christians to kill and condemn people of other faiths because Christianity rests on the fundamental tenet of man being created in God&#39;s image and God gives man free will. Man can choose to know who is God or reject God. God accepts man&#39;s choice. <br>&quot;Thou shall not kill&quot; is the 6th Commandment, and is rightly so as man is created in God&#39;s image. <br>Claims made out of context or without reasoning can incites acts of violence. <br><br>Fifth, to say that the British Empire pillaged and looted India because they were Christians is tantamount to saying Indian politicians and businesses scam and fraud their own Indian people because they are Hindus. People whether British or Indian do so on account of selfishness, greed, wealth and power. These are human traits and not religious or national identities.<br>People do so because they lack morality or accountability to oneself or towards others.<br><br>Choosing an ideology is easy, reasoning is the challenge. The cause why people easily adopt certain ideologies and fail to reason their thinking is a subject matter of thinking fast and slow. This is a problem with people irrespective of their faiths. We are fallible and gullible while we are quick to credit ourselves as wise. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)</a>. Hindu Taliban.... This guy has some knowledge.. bt filled with hatred What complete and utter bullshit, claiming that the vices of society came with the advent of Islam in the south Asian subcontinent. Hinduism and it’s practitioners have thoroughly subjugated women on the notion that it was from the divine. Look no further than the caste system. Muslims and well as Hindus died in the partition. My grandparents left Delhi I’n 1947 atrocities were commuted by both sides. The only way to rise above such hate is to unite our people’s. There is no difference between North Indians and Pakistanis. I think best time period for india was before 1000 ad. The decline could be contributed to decline in kshatriya society. As they became weak they were unable to defend india against invaders but resorting to violence now won&#39;t work Hindus have the highest infidelity amongst them. They sleep with each others wives and sisters. This  is why most Hindus love their religion. Also this guy is full of crap. call the isis sapporter and call it voice of islam <br>stupid press , stupidest i ever saw Horrible comments, i can’t belive it 2018, wake up. This video effectively tells about the misinterpretations of ideas by general people due to propagation by others. The public should rather than believing what told to be truth blindly, should try to find it first hand. This person shows educated uneducation. Winning of trump and putin is due to a plethora of reasons and not just this. And what about history? How can this person be so much blindly sure without studying anything but a misinterpreted and wrong history termed wrong by scholars and with no proof. Slavery existed duri Asoka, no woman were allowed to have property at the time. The worst part is most people even educated believe this man&#39;s viewpont. Haha fourth worst country in the world for religious violence? really-- are you sure about that? Mullah modi and his saffron taliban  must to sent to the dustbin history The guy is using pure logic..there is no &quot;nationalism&quot; in it. I have Muslim friends and I love them...I follow paskistani musicians and they are fabulous...I admire preachings from Sufism but I am against the idea of segregating society in the name of secularism. That&#39;s what you or other pseudo secular guys have been doing .. completely support this guy Bilkul sach btaya Sir aapne <br>I support you Hindu dharm real dharm baki baad me jo aaye sab fake2 i am christian and i support hindus. hindus are brothers Illiteracy is the great problem faced by North India. That&#39;s why there is religious riots and these politicians make use of such scenario too. People of North India are simple, uneducated poor people. <br>They are not to be blamed; its the fucking politicians of North India. jitna v defend krle admin...  lekin jo ye leh raha hai vo sach...hai. Ye chutiya bakwas kar raha hai. RSS ka bas chale toh wo India ko bhi Pakistan jaisa religious country banadenge. India better isiliye hai kyuki yaha religion aur government alag alag hain, lekin in chutiyo ko ye samajh nahi ayega abbe chu...chal jane de. Baare aye nationalist banne! lol. Only thing you said wrong was that the ideas of this man don&#39;t represent any &#39;Party&#39;. He clearly said he adores RSS the parent Organization of BJP, that is India&#39;s ruling party. Have to agree that except some things his views were actually correct. brain washed.....from core!! You highlighted the things that he quoted wrong &amp; what about things that he quoted right! He is correct. Hindu nationalists are more secular than secularists WTF Bro RSS never preaches these things people are making propaganda Tell him to read mahabarta then talk about the other religions According  to him muslim have no problem  with hindu&#39;s but must hate the hindusiam No matter how this  channel is trying to show wrong Image if Hindus . but that person had said everything correctly Very true I want to embrace Hinduism...which caste will i be granted...can i be a brahmin?? Now interview a Muslim nationalist and Christian nationalist. Then compare all three videos.<br>I bet this guy will look like a cool hippie in comparison. Pagal aadmi Wow I didn&#39;t know it has become a thing to warn before a video start to say&quot;WARNING contains blasphemy against Islam and Christiany Man FUCK ISLAM FUCK MUHAMMAD MUSTAFAFI FUCK CHRISTIANY A JEWISH RELIGION!!!! Gau Maas khane wale Pakistan chle jao Ohhhhh GOD .. This guy is such a racist and ignorant ..!!! The worst thing is that without any knowledge of Christianity and Islam he&#39;s barking like shit and people are praising it ... God Bless India You don&#39;t have to eat beef to be a Muslim. Lol we need find jobs or we will get    this kind of rubbish things Salo tom vi muglo ki njaj olad saleo appnia pheno ko phatano ko dech dete the...sali gandi olad Who is running this propaganda channel? RSS is the most peace-loving organization in the world which works to spread Indian cultural ethos and civilizational values. Don&#39;t malign it by talking to anyone and claiming that he&#39;s a Hindu nationalist. Who knows this guy wanted few minutes of fame and so he said that he studied in RSS-run school! Did you guys check his certificate? Bjp funded..!!! Interestingly...<br>What he said in the end was &quot;kuposhan aur bhook se na koi mare...&quot;  which I think is fair enough say that this video was partial.... Agar hum bhi muslims k sath esa kre Hindustan m toh bht hangama hoga. Religious fanatics are the hurdles to a nation&#39;s progress! It doesn&#39;t  matter if he or she comes from Hinduism,Islam or Christianity. Like Americans share and live the American dream, we Indians should have a collective Indian dream where India shines in all aspects of development. Instead, we are having a stupid ideological dream to drown India. We formed our constitution with &quot;Unity in Diversity&quot; as a primary motto. Now, we want to choose language,religion,caste etc etc over India&#39;s progress. Personally, I don&#39;t believe any religion as peaceful or dangerous. A religion is a tool like a knife. You can craft an art, use it to cook food for others or you can kill a person with it. The man who speaks here believes he is using violence as a principle of Dharma. Likewise,another brainwashed Islamic terrorist believes he is defending his God,Allah. And we also have religious racists called KKK in America who abuse Indian and Islamic migrants there. There is where people slip into extremism.  I hope India shines in progress atleast in the next generation with young minds. please look at the agenda behind this video. This sort of thinking will lead anyone to nowhere everyone has had suffered enough hindus muslims you name it. Who hasn&#39;t suffered but picking up some of bullet points will only spread hate and world already has enough of that so please oh please lets make world better place for living. man makes relegion then discriminate against people and blame the religion for his own faults what is your biggest expectations from the bjp govt?<br>ans : modi ji pm aur yogi ji cm..5-10 saal keliye...<br>😂😂😂 looks like this guy is misguided. i wonder even after  conducting this interview they didnt ask him about varna system, child marriage,sati and dowry and this mate goes on telling india was a matriarchal society before muslims. just another propagandist ,hindhu bashing and hindhu hating channel The truth is always bitter. Liberal snowflakes are not used to truth. Pity. The man have spoken the bitter truth. 99% truth Complete liar Look at this stupid idiot Hahaha taras aata hai ispe aur iske jaise logo pe saaf pata chalta hai RSS wale kitna dharam padhte aur padhate hai sabse pehle Quran mein jin kafiro ko marne ke liye kaha gaya tha wo sirf wo log the jo us zamane ke musalmano se jung chahate hai aur raha sawal har kaffir ( Nastik) ko marne ka toh 1000 saal ki hukumat thi musalmano ki is desh mein bahot time tha puri hindu kuam ko mitane ke liye aur hindu dharam ka Adhyan kare hinduo ke mutabik bhuddist aur jaini adharmi hai kyun ke yeh vedic bhagwan ya bhramin duara rache bhagwano ko nahi mante aur inke adharmi mana gaya hai jinko narak mein dala jayenga afsoos hota hai inke jaise logo ko dekh kar dharam ko na padhte hai na sikhte I thought Bhatias were snobs. Awesome. Pagan prick, cast system is probably the most unjust system in the world and he dares to preach others about injustice. <b>i just hate him and his stupid face!</b> I am a Hindu I don&#39;t believe in this kind of stereotypical things. ~हिंदु कौन~<br>काल्पनिक कथाओं को गर सच मान बैठे हो तो हिंदु हो तुम|<br>पाठशाला छोड कर गर वेदों मे ग्यान ढुंढ रहे हो तो हिंदु हो तुम|<br>काबिलीयत नहि गर वर्णों से ईंसान परखते हो तो हिंदु हो तुम|<br>   ~  Few Lines by me Very well said We all should follow only one religion.... That is <br>HUMANITY as someone who knows many hindu extremists, i can tell you that they do hate muslims..they are all almost totally fine with christians though Wah modiji waah! haan be quran ka chapter quote kar raha hain aur keh raha hain ki if your own brother dosent accept christianity he is to be killed......totally biased and mis information, this shows how dangerous is incomplete knowledge So what ever he said is wrong according to you, you must be blinded by pseudo-secularism. If you clear your mind , only then you will be able to see that what ever this man is saying is truth. A epic in which whole fight is desribed for the honor of one woman is not matriarchal, then supposedly having harams, ploygamy is matriarchal according to you. yaar diplomat walo, Kavi mujhse v kuchh puchh Liya karo... This guy is right. Bible was later created by Constantine and he falsely attributed it to the apostles. It is called nycean creed. Coming from a Muslim family, I can vouch that Muslims hate every non Muslim instead admitting to the fact that most of the rapes, riots happened during recent times, i mean, when so called nationalist came into power ,this guy is bashing the Muslims. This is why we hunt down this mother fuckers in Kerala. Whether you’re Indian or Pakistani, just look into this man’s eyes...he could be your Ramu or Rahim Chacha...he could be any of us. I see and listen to him...he could be on either side of the border drinking his chai in a glass, speaking his version of “truths,” so sad to see how we hate our own brothers on either side of the border. I don’t even blame the British, this hatred is entirely of our own making and now we pay the price!! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m44s\">6:44</a> isne droupadi ki bat ki to duryodhan kounse religion ko belong karta tha And according to Hindu mythology...Shri Krishna used to stole the clothes of girls taking bath..(is it fine to do that in today’s India any one please tell me) sai chutiya h😑 What a foolish and goobar brain person he is Yeah. Nationalism is a bad word now. Isn&#39;t it?<br>But muslims who divide the world into Muslim and non muslim world and are straight forward told to wage jihad against non muslims are good. Isn&#39;t it? You bleedy paid marxist morons journos. 😂😂😂😂 uneducated person about quran Being a nationalist is good. But why being a &quot;Hindu Nationalist&quot;?<br>He is none other than an illiterate pseudo nationalist. He can be described as a blind supporter of BJP and RSS, which are indirectly united ;(. The only thing I want to convey is just don&#39;t be like him ever. Every holy books in the world only provoke unity in diversity( method of writings are different). To be honest, I am a hindu and I belive all are my brothers and sister, no matter which religion, caste,class or creed they belong. And yes we exist.. :) Uneducated people like him are the reason humanity is falling. Fucked up people. Watch a brain washed<br>Zara chutiye Ko bolo<br>Varna system me kitna zulm Kiya hai Saudi arabia have a square they kill people. Cut there head. how dumb and brainwashed he is? Proud to be HINDU .. Straight forward...............indian Guess what sir ! I’m also a Hindu and has done my schooling from Saraswati shishu mandir and Vidya mandir which are products of RSS but thank god don’t think like you. Only difference I know is good people or bad people and no matter even if anyone does wrong to me. I won’t judge him on the basis of his community,race, country,caste or religion. Pathetic and disgraceful thinking. 😂😂😂😂 blame Islam for everything &amp; I can&#39;t understand this person is illegitimate son his mother whose husband is muslim. That&#39;s RSS true face u never be win with us. Chutia He is fully wrong about the Bible. He is a liar. Bible is not written by Consantinople. There is no verse in the Bible which asks us to kill others. You liar!! Fake propaganda against Sangh Pariwar and hindu people.<br>Jayatu Sangh Jayatu hindu<br>Bharat mata ki jai 🚩🚩 Har Har Mahadev Fake interview. News people paid him very well too speak the script Haan Islam se phele to crime to nahi hora tha naa.?<br>Don&#39;t be nationalist be patriot. Understand difference assholes.<br>Meri Hindus se problem nahi hai Hinduism se hai.Mujhey religion following people se problem nahi hai religion se hai.<br>Aise chutiye sale Jo dharam ko insaniyat se bade mante hain .......Go fuck yourself. Suni sunaee baatein ...!<br>Khud se kabhi  fact checking nahi krna bas dohratein rahna   ... Ye kis bhakt ka Le liya Interview anpat kahe ka..<br>Rss ne is dimag he nhe is ki 5 pidi bhi chod diye Example of a gobar dimag🤣😂 Being anti BJP myself, I think he justified his points well. why did not you show facts about the Hindu, Sikh killings after he spoke about it at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=3m43s\">3:43</a>  ,where as  all other parts of the video you showed your facts ??? Thats the reason pakistan made and india was divided... Quide Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah wanted unity of hindus and muslims but persons like him forced Jinnah to take steps for the rights of muslims... Jai Shri Ram found least educated who is pushing valid point but able honey coating...  come inteview me Wow what a hypocrite is he ... In one sentence he is giving the verses of Quran and Bible for the violence .. and in the next sentence he is giving the reference of  Ram and Guru Gobind ... He himself proving how paid knowledge he is got from his bhagwa group ..... Just one request to everyone pls go through to the Bible and Quran or any religious book before believing the falsehood spread from the paid organisation .. Ghai ke naam par eensaan ko marna mara khayal sa bakwaan khush nahee haa.. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=5m55s\">5:55</a> i agree they build 3 mosque in my area and its a hindu majority there are no Muslims and no one comes in those mosque but they made it idk why I won&#39;t say Christians or Christianity is bad they are good but the Islam is a real threat now to the world what he said about it is very true Modi&#39;s era about to End in 2019 😆 I feel sorry for him. The man is right, Christian and Islamic crusades have caused a lot of destruction globally within 50 seconds he says RSS. anything he said after that wasn&#39;t a surprise. Can they make video on psedo seculars...World is suffering badly due to appeasement...Still shameless secular media is performing their practices...Can they deny that invaders like khlilji ,Babar ,Gauri destroyed the books and temples architects...Bastard they were ... Iske dimag mai rss ka kachra bhar diya gaya hai... Or kuch nahi.. Islamophobia has been spoonfed  to him....he has no proper knowledge of islam and what the Quran says.....it is the duty of muslims to not only spread awareness about true islam but to practically demonstrate the true virtues of a Muslim.....this is how we can help build our society n help it prosper help our nation prosper.....i think those who do divisive politics are the biggest threat to the development of my nation India....we all should work hand in hand....muslims are an integral part of India.....RSS should realise this fact....n pls no hateful comments on me, pls. This person is at contradiction with his own views.. He&#39;s not a true Hindu. Hindu Dharma speaks of peace and real tolerance. Really proud. I love this man i also want to join rss hindu is victim of islam n christian Buddhism Hinduism jainism Sikhism all talk about peace Well said I am Hindu nationalist From 0 to 7.28 min. Honest words!!!<br>🕉🕉🕉🕉🕉 Sahi bola truth is bitter!!! The Diplomat is a Dog of Gandhi Family. Ek video Muslim extremist ki bhi banao Yes in India there is religious unrest because there are many religions and everyone has freedom of religion. Not like other countries where other religions are wiped out.  The diplomat is trying to portray half truth.   They won&#39;t tell you about  genocides of Hindus in other countries.  The only talk about Muslims and Christians. There are many other religions also who don&#39;t have any problems. Christians and Muslims are trying to convert as many as Hindus they lure poor people. Christianity has improved a little bit but Islam doesn&#39;t seems to improve at all. Hindiusm has no problem with other religions but Christianity and  Islam has. Not saying every Muslim or Christian is bad there are many good people.  I&#39;m saying India is perfect but it&#39;s improving and it will take time. Ye Chutiya kaun hai Such a foolish guy You are misguided... You are spreading your own understanding of the world... You will never be peaceful.... Peace be with u idiot JAY HIND Bhosdiwalon  .. logically counter karo.maachodon  .... aaise title kya de rha hai ... gaandu .<br><br> Counter kr proof k saath ki.quran <a href=\"http://me.ye/\">me.ye</a> sb ni.likha hmaare against .<br>.<br><br>.

It&#39;s his personal view, why dragging all the nationalists. I differ with him because the Christian faith (The New Testament)  does not advocate violence or hate against ANY religion.    His references are probably the Old Testament old hebrew canon and laws from Ancient Israel.  Those laws do not apply and Christ even speaks about loving one another.   <br>Islamic religion is the opposite, they mention to crush, destroy and subjugate non Muslims.Its mentioned very explicitly in the Quran Surah 5. Daliton ke saath Jo atyaachaar, Jo ye 1000 saalon se karte aae Hain, wo bhi Islam aur Christianity ne kiya. Lol, true image -totally brainwashed ,who cannot think on his own.<br>WE THE PEOPLE OF INDIA (CONSTITUTIONS FIRST LINE)GET DISTRACTED BY THESE KIND OF PEOPLE. Make and spread fake hatred against hindus you lousy bastards Even peaceful religion ,becoming extrimist... Now what is differen e between them and hindus ... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=02m17s\">02:17</a> <br><br> Deuteronomy 13:6-9 King James Version (KJV)<br><br> 13:6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;<br><br>13:7 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;<br><br>13:8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:<br><br>13:9 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. Bhaiyya ap jio hazar saaal long live RSS long live BJP Thank you for showing the true face of Indian secularism. At least you are honest like many of your fellow Sanghis who claim tolerance and stab from the back. Make claims and then don&#39;t provide any data to support it . Exactly the kind of thinking that will lure a so called Hindu nationalist. If that&#39;s the case, then I claim the opposite of whatever he said. Now prove me wrong. I&#39;M A HINDU BORN IN THE WEST! Mother India Is Our Second Mother!    The Power of Sanatan Dharma!<br>VANDAE MATARAM JAI HIND! Hindu Nationalist ? Is he spilling over into other Nations and establishing his supremacist Nationalism ? No, he&#39;s in his native land. May peace be unto you.. Noble Quran chapter 5 verse 32.also he is not aware of the Gender rights in Islam. Can there be more discrimination in India <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m25s\">2:25</a> ? where did Christian stone any non-believer to death? Send some link here?BTW  hindu extremist exist. Christian people who follow Jesus properly does many good deeds. Without education where will India be?  Jesus is coming back soon. End time is near. Come to know Lord Jesus Christ. <br>Are Hindus getting stone in Christian countries or are you benefiting from them?<br>Hindu is pagan. You killing girls, caste system,girls dying for dowry, sati system, these are his personal views This idiot has no knowledge Forget about the Vaishnava kings destroyed Buddhism and its temples and converted into Hindu temples. stupid religious robot.Ask him to lear Jagannatha mandir and so may others. Yes, all Abrahamic religion and its books have with violence and old testament has more violence. then what about stupid Ramayana and Mahabharata which is the story of war? how can a god Go war with his own creation? <br>all religion are fucking lie created to fool idiots and control the people. That Krishna himself fucked so may women and this bugger says islam taught. All Muslim people are showing there real face in comments.  Thay were talking about peace world wide externally but at the same time inide they are communist and they don&#39;t respect other religion.  muslim brothers remember Hindus are tolerant that&#39;s doesn&#39;t mean we will be silent all the time.. plz stop hating Look at this fool, He initially says Muslims in pakistan shunted his family out of pakistan but his fight is against Islam and not against Muslims.<br>I heard it was absolute power which corrupts but here its also the Religion.<br>Winston Churchill was absolutely right while describing indians. Jai Shree Ram Allah hu Akbar kaho nai to jao? Dafuq? Konsa Islam zabardasti religion force krta hay. As a Pakistani I disagree. He is free to adopt whatever religion he like even in PK. <br><br>And regarding verse, that was in according to specific scene, dont forget to read context before coming to conclusion. I support This guy 100% , shame on the reporter !!!! Jai Hind Jai RSS bilkul sahi bol raha hai banda... kaun madarchod keheta hai ki woh galat hai??? This guy has his head so up his ass. He is so brainwashed he is right I believe in what this guy just said.<br><br>Can any rational person explain why it is wrong??<br>For my knowledge.<br>To note:kindly abstain from using knowledge

ko islam sa jhod do khud kabhi na bdlo bhut shi👌 I sense the frustration in this man, but an eye for an eye logic is exactly what the radicals follow. Protesting without violence is alright, but once you use violence, you should be arrested. Christians se problem hai par christian schools mein bacho ko padhYenge, christian country ki job chahiye nri banna hai. Muslim country jana hai job ke liye kyunki paise ache hain. Wah bahut badhiya itna hindu hindu karte ho toh bahar kyun jate ho tab sharm nahi ati. Brainwashed idiots. He is absolutely right now The Hindu nationalist is saying as if there were no wars and homicides before Christ. Even I am like him and I am not alone in this fight Imagine this story : <br>A Man living happily owning 3 houses on large area of land. Suddenly one day Robber comes and ties him up, Steals his Belongings and tortures him and rapes his wife and has children with her and claims all 3 Houses that never belonged to him. After many decades, The Robber is kicked out but he cries and demands the Property be shared with his Bastard children that he had with the original Owner&#39;s wife.<br><br>Should the Robber&#39;s kids have equal rights to the Owner&#39;s original Entire Property ? Of course not - You will say the Robber or his Children doesn&#39;t even deserve even 1 of the 3 Houses belonging to the Original owner yet in India&#39;s case, The Robber&#39;s children were given 2 Houses - Pakistan and Bangladesh !!! <br><br>Now do you think the Robber&#39;s children are happy ? No.. They are Greedy now and want to claim the House that Owner is living in, After losing his 2 Homes.. This will never happen, This time the Original House Owner will grab whatever weapon he can and kill the Greedy Robber&#39;s Children and reclaim all 3 of his lands, If they try !!! So beware Robber children, You need to be grateful to the Hindus for what they have given you so far.. What an incredible display of ignorance!!!😫😫😫.He talks like no violence is committed by hindus in the name of hinduism.<br>Hinduism also has its fair share of atrocities committed in the past.<br>I am an atheist but i dont like this guys attitude. abhai chutiah women who are abused are mostly by hindues ...not by muslms  chutiah logic,islam save them from rape....tum un ko nanga karte hu. Propaganda video is being made by the <a href=\"http://diplomat.com/\">diplomat.com</a>, picking some random guy, showing some unauthenticated data and portraying India as most intolerant nation,see diplomat or whosoever with few subscriber you cannot convey some biased msg by just picking or showing few random people&#39;s mentality. Mazhab nahi sikhata apas me bair rakhna.          Hindi hai hum vatan hai hindustan hamara If Hinduism is the religion of tolerance, then how come killing a man for transporting cows is right. This guy was being highly hypocritical. Since when did Hinduism became india and india became Hinduism. So many ignorant idiots in the comments section who don&#39;t know shit about Islam or Christianity, openly being racist. Christianity and Islam are the top 2 religions in the world and there is a reason for it. May Allah give all you naive people enlightenment. He have not enough knowledge, but he is right about Islam which preach hate against non-believer. Now what happening in Europe after migrant Criss, Sweden is now rape capital, Paris is now chaotic city full of violence and theft. Only one word chuitya no knowledge Shame on u Hindu Muslim are best christans should stop conversion other wise get ready to face persecution I am a Christian. And I agree with this man... Hinduism is the future Lies, Hate Hame aase log Apne mulk me Nahi chaiye.. love Islam and Christianity Nice Crazy people is good for India! hahhaha Aise chutio Ko goli maardi Through appeasement, a place called Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, has turned into a majority Muslim place. In Pakistan, Hindus are being killed every week. Hindu women are kidnapped in Sindh and told to convert their religion and names and to Begum Khan, etc. no one cares for them. Same thing is happening now to Sikhs in Pakistan and they are being asked to convert by pressure. Diplomat, why don’t you do a video on Hindus in Pakistan or Asamai Hindus in Afghanistan? Why don’t you do a video on Kashmiri Pandits who were killed or fled over many decades? Aren’t they also human beings? Chuttad hindu saaala Sala admi mental hea.... he should refrain from speaking about Islam and Christianity - he is not qualified, educationally and morally First, it shows what happens to you when you never maintained any personal relationship with other religion poeple. Even Hindu scriptures and beliefs have many idiotic things. Does that mean I am a supporter of that. Do Muslim and Christian whom I have known always do everything according to what is written in their holy books. Second, He says he has personal connections with ministers. So they are also the same bigot he is. Third, he justifies violence in small issues as Traffic. He didn&#39;t had any other means. 10 poeple can&#39;t do any peaceful dharna pradarshan. Moreover he said he had contacts. Fourth, about women. If I speak openly many will track me down to kill me. Lets be clear on this. Women are ill treated everrywhere. And &quot; ill treated is wrong word&quot;. Hope you get the gist. Now how to stop such poeple narrating the direction this country takes. Think on this!!! All these wannabe reporters from wannabe neutral media...can S*** my D***.Its biased to the core.Letting this man speak n then  showing  some  headlines which says exactly the opposite,but with no references,what kinda journalism is this!? INDIA MAI SIRF HINDU HOGA BAKI KATWE KI SIRF YAHA MAA CHODA JAYEGA BAS <b>ALLAH</b> Ka Bohat Shukr Hai Ke Mai <b>MUSLIM</b> Hu Thanks To Allah This is complete propaganda by The Diplomat. There is little research done. This is Anti Hindu propaganda as repeatedly shown &quot;unsubstantiated claim&quot; in the bracket. Only one person is shown. Only partly it is true and in that case this Hindu is correct regarding Islam and Christianity. Bhai apni beti ki shadi bhi 5 se karwa de...chutiye gambling Juwan khelte hue hare they dropdi ko.. yeh bhi yad hai k nahi...this is ur women empowerment in Hinduism.... No one is Saint. Everyone is bad means human. Whatever This dude dude has said is 100% true!<br>Sanatan dharma is best religion in the world! Let&#39;s say for the sake of argument Muslims and Christians are Bad Religion but Hindu supposed to believe in Saving life respecting life if so why do you have so much hatred because my friend is Hindu and he&#39;s nothing like this guy Bible aur quran dono ko ye banda galat tarah se dikha raha hai...ek sentence se meaning dikha raha hai....ye jo bol raha hai wo command tha jab disbelievers ne hamla kiya tha tab command aaya tha ki attack karo battle me...bhai juth bolke nafrat mat felao. Rss  makes people terrorists by washing their  brains by giving wrong interpitation of history ....<br> Hindus r mean minded and fealty...... India needs more people like this ..... thanks god Does Diplomat know that RSS has a Muslim Rang Manch? You interview a person with a very less awareness and call him a as a foot soldier nationalist? He was exposed to conditions most of us never would have, he was effected by his own experiences i.e. Pakistan Partition etc. Now why dont you interview one of  the other kind among the nationalists, who, have a PhD in STEM and have been exposed to multiple cultures. Still are the RSS memebers. These second category would have left RSS, had they found anything wrong with RSS.  THis second category of people maintain the same tone as this gentleman here has maintained. Even though his exposure is limited, but he expressed his views, which are quite acceptable. Although, I do have disagreements on certain parts of his views on Muslims. But overall he was saying that &quot; appeasement must stop, merit must come&quot;. I donot see anything wrong with the gist. The RSS doesnt call for attack on minorities. So sad... Mere hindu bhai bhtbsare frnds h koi inke jaise sochte nhi.. Sb bht acche h pata nhi yelog kahan se aake hindu nam k badnam kr rahe h Some people who wonder as to why these leftists (or self claimed intellectuals) support these extremely dogmatic Mullas almost every time in the name of liberalism despite of their  contradictory ideologies, here are my reasons for them:<br>     1) Since Karl Marx has found nothing glorifiable as such in Indian History and blame  our culture and tradition only for all the poverty, inequality and Caste System in the society and thus deliberately ignore the dark and brutal side of Invasion; hence no wonder why his followers popularly known as leftists did not spare any chance when in power to malign everything related to Hindu Culture (if I may use it for Sanatana Tradition). Some of these leftists are completely convinced by the western indologists without doing proper poorvapaksha(analysis), while some others are confused or have ulteriar motives and some others have ego (due to belongingness to an already established popular fashionable elite ideology) on their way which keeps them in denial mode for almost everything related to glory of India. <br>         <br>          Similarly, these forcely converted Muslims of Indian Subcontinent (ashamed of the cowardice of their ancestors) suffering from inferior complexity, try to over-compensate it with some kind of superior complexity by denouncing their ancestry to our  civilization and attaching themselves to that of Arabian although even Arabs too don&#39;t take them as one of their own. They try to even attach themselves to so called legacy of Muhammad bin Qasim, Timur, Ghazanvi and Aurangzeb type of traitors (who broke thousands and thousands of our temples and were responsible for genocide of lakhs of innocent Hindus), only to hide their embarrassment that their ancetors couldn&#39;t resist and agreed to convert in fear of sword or jaziya( special tax for Hindus) finally. Although some clever Muslim Scholars accept their Hindu ancestry but only to point out injustice and inequality in the form of Caste System so that they can blame Caste system fully responsible for their conversion and not any external pressure. However they all would say in one voice that they changed due to Sufism in Islam, which I don&#39;t see anywhere now a days but still people are converting. <br>By the way, these Muslims and Marxists who talk so much about Caste System never want to talk about Ashraf ( Arabic word that means &#39;noble&#39; which includes all undoubted descendants of foreigners and convert from high caste Hindus )and Ajlaf ( contemptuous Arabic term that means &#39;wreteches&#39; or &#39;mean people&#39; which include all other Mahomedans comprising the occupational groups and converts of lower ranks; they are also called Kamina or Itar, &#39;base&#39; or Rasil, a corruption of Rizal, &#39;wothless&#39;). <br>In some places a third class , called Arzal or &#39;lowest of all&#39;, is added. With them no other Mahomedan would associate, and they are forbidden to enter the mosque, to use the public burial ground. Have anyone ever heard these self claimed secular and liberal intelletuals complain against discrimination against lower strata Muslims? Even if somebody would dare to speak against this, these leftists (whom I call professinal mouners or &#39;Rudali&#39; in desi bhasa) jump in to defend by saying it is their personal law safeguarded by the Constitution itself. I would say that unfortunatley even our Constitution Makers didn&#39;t address all this dicrimination in other communities while making the Constitution.<br>And that&#39;s why there are &#39;Ghar Wapsis&#39; or &#39;Bari fera&#39; going on in Muslim community as well, some forced by extremist Hindu groups but most by themselves from within.<br><br>          Yes everything in our culture is not perfect, yes we have Caste System which was deliberately misinterpreted as birth-based (instead of an individual&#39;s ability-based irrespective of his family background) by the then self claimed Brahmans in greed of centralizing all power, wealth ,knowledge and land; but we would uproot this blot of Caste System very soon from our society by teaching people Sanskrit, making Shrutis (Vedas and Upnishads) available at every home and updating Smritis (which inculde Shastras, Kavyas and Puranas) as mentioned in scriptures already (well that&#39;s our issue how to end this menace), but the point I am talking about is that these leftists and Muslims bash everything &#39;desi&#39; is due to their common hatred for Indian Culture.<br><br>     2) The very Marxist idea of helping Minority at the cost of knocking Majority suits these Muslims since this strategy of claiming more and more when in Minority (Dar-Al-Harb) but not giving the same rights to Minorities when themselves in Majority (Dar-Al-Islam) is an indoctrinated strategy in Quran, known as Al-Taqiyya for spreading Islam by hook or crook. This is the reason you would see why both these Leftists and Muslims often ask Hindus for Tolerance only and not Mutual-Respect (Respect for Respect and Disrespect for Disrespect irrespective of who is showing first) in deterrence because they very well know that this hypocrisy of Tolerance can&#39;t stand by the idea of Mutual-Respect and hence it can&#39;t bring genuine Acceptance too in society ever.<br>  <br>           Look, everybody knows how religiously intolerant Muslims are against non-believers (Kafirs) when they get an adequate number on their side. Otherwise I challenge, can anyone explain that as soon as Govt  would bring some population policy equally applicable to all communities, why do only Muslims start crying? Can any Muslim brother justify why does not a single Muslim majority country not democratic and secular except Turkey, Malaysia whose condition is getting even more and more worsened by Wahabism since last decade as we all know and Indonesia which has not yet given up her Hindu culture even after adopting a new religion? My point therefore is that this Hypocrisy of demanding more and more (like reservation in employment or not accepting Uniform Civil code, etc) and hiding behind Secularism and Democracy when in Minority; and then showing true colors (by killing all non-believers before qayamat or reduce them to servants) when in Majority as an indoctrination of Al-Taqiyya would never go, no matter how much they chant &quot;Islam is a religion of peace&quot;.<br><br>     3) Although both these Leftists and Muslims have their own logic against Nationhood, but both of them in common don&#39;t believe in territorial boundaries.<br>   <br>           Leftists believe that the boundaries between every 2 Nation should be dismissed since this world is a single place as a whole and therefore everybody should have right  to wonder anywhere in this &quot;global village&quot; on the Humanitarian basis. However, they contradict themselves by also saying that India is not a Nation,it is a subaltern Nation which should be disintegrated among various provinces (as it was before Independence, and that&#39;s why they are against Sardar Vallabhai Patel for convincing 450 provinces out of all 600 to stay in India) based on language, culture, region, ethnicity, etc..<br><br>           And, Muslims according to overwhelmly popular, most dominant and widely accepted School of Thoughts of Wahabsm(Sunni dominated concept), are preached to believe that Religion is the permanent basis of Nationhood. Even Civilization and Culture emerge from Religion only according to them. They don&#39;t believe in Motherland or Fatherland concept, because for them every single territory is just like another piece of land which has no life and hence can be invaded for Caliphate or disintegrated to invade again as an indoctrinated strategy of Al-Taqiyya. But the reason they give cunningly is that people have never been at one place in Human History and have always migrated from one place to another in search of food,shelter and security from natural hazards for survival, when the fact is that until people in the ancient age got evolved and found ways of staying at one place i.e through cultivation and cattle farming, they used to roam. But as soon as people developed new ways of settling down and surviving without running from from one place to another, the concept of Civilization came which consequently brought the concept of culture comprising language, food,belief systems,etc.<br><br>But the most important thing is the way you see how these self claimed intellectuals defend Islamic invasions and dogmas by making a fear out of this that if you would talk much about their wish for Islamic riyasat-e-Caliphate, Ghazwa-e-Hind, Ummah (loyalty to international Community), Al-Taqiyya(based on the hypocritical concepts of Dar-Al-Islam, Dar-Al-Harab and Dar-Al-Amn), then they would be more violent. This is the most hypocritical rubbish reasoning, I think they could give with all their intellect to justify why it is important for them to cricize Hindu extremeism instead of Islamic intentions worldwide by cunningly turning the allegation of Islamophile upon them into Islamophobe. brainwashed bhaktard like rest of his bhaktard fellows.....pathetic..feel pity for such people....living in world of their own far from reality.....the organisations spreading such ideologies are real terrorists My no. Is 9003987103<br><br>ask him to prove me that quran induces terrorism!!<br><br>Allah SWT says:<br><br>وَالَّذِيْنَ لَا يَدْعُوْنَ مَعَ اللّٰهِ اِلٰهًا اٰخَرَ وَلَا يَقْتُلُوْنَ النَّفْسَ الَّتِيْ حَرَّمَ اللّٰهُ اِلَّا بِالْحَـقِّ وَلَا يَزْنُوْنَ  ۚ  وَمَنْ يَّفْعَلْ ذٰ لِكَ يَلْقَ اَثَامًا  <br>&quot;And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.&quot;<br>(QS. Al-Furqaan: Verse 68) Iska dukh dard sacha hai. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a> As a completely unbiased person, ill tell you that what he said is true. Not educating women is islamic/arab stuff. Its not prevalent anywhere in ancient india or india prior to islamic influence. So by you guys putting (unsubstantial claim) on the top doesnt discredit anything. I noticed how you didnt follow up with what he said with any type of statistics or article refuting what he said lol.  Do your research on the FIRST university in the whole word, in INDIA. Nalanda university, all genders were educated! Also islamic jnvaders destroyed nalanda and burned millions of books. All knowledge that went up in complete flames, this was not only a loss to India but all of mankind. What is he said at some points are absolutely right but the idea of secularism is respecting faith of other religions.The modern trend of spreading hatred in the name of extremism via by hardliner Hindu activist, self acclaimed liberals like Ambedkarites or some dalits who wants to hate higher sect of Hindus for their ancestor&#39;s old tradition, The Radical Islamists who cheered for hate speeches of owasi or the christian missionaries who wants to exploit with their paid conversions. All these are blamed for making disturbances in secular society. Sala Pakistan Ka agant he.. mad**d ye sala RSS or ISISI Ka aatakwadi he ye... Pakistan se Aaya he ye sala madar***d Beautifully TAILORED MISLEADING  story. But unfortunately, intelligent people will be able to spot your PROPAGANDA.<br>India has been and always will be a peaceful country. India is proud of its unity in diversity. <br>I am a proud Hindu. Being a Hindu I respect all religions. Well, why didn&#39;t you interview me? Just because it won&#39;t go in line with your PROPAGANDA? At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=2m05s\">2:05</a>, there isnt a single verse in the gospel of Christ where god commands man to kill another man. By this video we can clearly understand how islam is spread by force. My question to the indian people, how did Christianty and the bible conquer the roman empire hundreds of years before the armies of islam arrived? Such a shit on humanity is this guy. How ugly these guys look. Murderers and Rapists! Hindu nationalists are the most stupid people ever.  With over 80% of the population being Hindu, they still believe that Muslims can take control of India.  Some of them even believe that Muslims reproduce so quickly that they will take over the country. <br><br>The truth is that the BJP, RSS are using these useful fools to divide and rule. By playing on the fears of these useful fools, they polarise society, raise Hindus against minorities and benefit politically.  <br><br>Worst, the cunning Brahmins are relentlessly enforcing their racist ideology of cast.  From the shadows, the Brahmins are crafting ruses that benefit the reviled racist and dangerous    caste system.<br><br>The situation is not different from Nazi Germany where Hitler promoted a racist nationalism excluding the minorities such as Jews.  This resulted in the genocide of Jews and minorities.  The situation is unfolding in asimilar way in India where Hindutva has replaced Nazism and the Muslims have replaced the Jews.  Indians will have to answer to the world sooner or later. bhai ..... lagta hai forebrain develop nhi keiya hh He is referring to Guru Gobind Singh Ji. I want to say him &quot;u moron don&#39;t ever say this again. Sikhs fought against the cruel rulers of that time not Islam. Sikhs have friendly relations with everyone. Don&#39;t drag our try to justify the fucking shit u r saying using our ideology. He is saying that he is in favour of Sikhs its a complete lie. They are backstabbing us.   Believe me RSS is trying to eliminate Sikhs by changing our history. Look people this video is clearly exposing agenda of RSS. The most peaceful Religion is Jainism!! And Jainism is the only way of Life, which truly <b>understands and practices</b> the concept of Ahimsa (Peace &amp; Non Violence)!! But only in Self-Defense we Jains will fight. And throughout history, Jain Kings and Jain Emperors have fought and won wars <b>in order to defend their Kingdoms and Empires !</b> Foolish mentality! This guy has. No Godly religions have caused immorality and violence. Not even Islam and Christianity. Its all about how <b>every individual understands one&#39;s Faith.</b> So no religions are to be blamed. However, if you say Christianity and Islam caused violence. Then we can say, <b>Hinduism caused the horrible and corrupt Caste System.</b> So every religion has <b>ups and downs, INCLUDING HINDUISM.</b> So never blame a religion. Blame the <b>PEOPLE&#39;s MENTALITY.</b> love you brother....u r right...if anyone think that hindu dhrm is not great search on google (world oldest religion) haha he says before Islam there was no abuse of women in India... how about<br>- Sati (widow burning) <br>- Child Brides Listen Bigot, Bible was not written 300 years after the resurrection of Christ. It&#39;s written by his disciples. I can talk about ur religion too but I won&#39;t because we are better than you. I love India and I&#39;m not Hindu nationalist christianity preaches love to all,even to enemies.This mans opinion on Christianity is false.Christianity encourages non violence Trying to defame the Hindus!! <br>Keep trying 😷😷 Don&#39;t agree with him but I have a fact to share. There are 7 to 8 states in India where Hindus are a minority. You won&#39;t believe that even after 70 years of independence, Hindus have not been given minority status in those states. Only a few days earlier a committee was formed to look into this. That is the level of &#39;take for granted&#39; attitude shown towards Hindus in India. This happens because Hindus don&#39;t complain. Shun violence, but do fight for your rights. As  a Sikh I am disgusted by these ignorant views of Indian Nationalists.<br>I note the 1984 genocide against Sikhs in Delhi is reference as &quot;Sikhs got beat up&quot; when the reality is that tens of thousands of Indian Sikhs were killed,  tortured and raped by thier fellow Indian Hindus, all sponsored by the Indian State. <br>He also makes misguided  reference to Guru Gobind Singh,  who actually fought against tyrants. There is no such verse in Christianity that tells you to stone your brother (or anybody) who rejects Christianity. That&#39;s why he couldn&#39;t quote the verse. He has been brainwashed by that BJP cult. Jesus taught to love even one&#39;s enemy.  If man can not love his seen brother or fellow humane being, how can he love the unseen God.  If Christianity is what you people mention, give me one example of of a Christian teaching to kill any one or hate any one.  Jesus Christ taught to love every humane being - that love was expressed on the Cross of Calvary.  There is no love greater than giving one own&#39;s life to the loved one.  You read the New Testament of the Bible which is containing the teaching of Jesus Christ and His desciples.  You can not find a single verse teaching to harm any humane being. About Islam: <br><br>Ahmad Ali<br>Fight those <b>*people of the Book (christians and jews)*</b> who do not believe in God and the Last Day, who do not prohibit what God and His Apostle have forbidden, nor accept divine law, until <b>*all of them (all christians and all Jews)*</b> pay protective tax in submission. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=9m29s\">9:29</a><br><br>The above verse is crystal clear. Now who is lying here? What context exists here? There is no context... Stupid diplomat claims no verse talks about punishing unbelievers in bible. Has he read the bible? The guy correctly referred to bible verses which said that even if a brother or sister worships other gods, they should be stoned to death..<br><br>Deuteronomy 13:6-10New International Version (NIV)<br><b>*6 If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known,*</b> <br><br>7 <b>*gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other), *</b><br><br>8 do not yield to them or listen to them. Show them no pity. Do not spare them or shield them. <br><br>9 You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first in putting them to death, and then the hands of all the people. <br><br>10 <b>*Stone them to death,*</b> because they tried to turn you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. Kaun chutiya hai ye Wow! Putin is anti-islam go get  get some knowledge first. Putin ordered for building Russia&#39;s largest mosque and donated about 5-6 million dollars. Propaganda terrorism against Hindus and Hinduism ! His views about islam are true the prophet of Islam raped a 3 year old girl and murdered so many innocent jews ,he is right ! Bullshit!!! He possesses a lot of misinterpreted information. He is just angry of the fact that they were chased out of Pakistan because of his religion. But his quoting of religious texts from the quran and Bible are absolutely false and misleading. RSS ideologies इनको आंतकवादी सिर्फ मुस्लिम और सिख ही नज़र आते है। आंतकवादी सिर्फ बन्दूक वाला ही नही होता।वह भी अन्तकवादी है जो दूसरे के धर्म प्रति नफ़रत का माहौल बनाता है और धर्म के नाम पर अपने समुदाय के लोगों की भीड़ को दूसरे धर्म के समुदाय के प्रति भड़काता है। मुँह में राम राम बगल में छुरी। 6.33 ladkiyo ko cheda nahi jata tha,,sita mata ko utha liya ravan ne aur ye chutiya kya bakwaas kar raha Nice..

Dear Brothers,,, Islam &amp; Christanity both have same agenda is converting people to their religion. Christanity do it by giving money and facilities( they are more focused in rural areas). They look for people who are poor, so money can easily convert them.<br>Now Islam, they are doing their best to convert people.. for example in Pakistan at the time of independence the hindu population was 23% and now its only 1%...where the 22% of Hindus gone.<br>in India they are trying to do LOVE JIHAD...so that hindu population can be reduced and muslim can increase. Islam is also paying money for converting.<br><br>If you see Christans from Europe are far superior than in India converted Christians..Dont  know why christian who are converted are taught to hate Hindus..<br>These all converted People are totally worst...worst than the original.... This is just the &quot;Mind of a brainwashed indian by Cowdung bhakts&quot;.

He May Be Hindu But Not Natiolist..... pakka ye pakistani. chennal he Spreading your religion by peace and encouragement is not communal.. And moreover RSS had nothing to do with religion Indians Hindus have no choices. They have to protect their religion, dignity,  peace and sovereignty of their nation. No Marsi INDIA. BURMA. thy Quite . Muslim This Regons This is not the real  ideology of a hindu nationalist. Unfortunately he can&#39;t understand hinduism. I don&#39;t know about how he was raised but nobody teach us anything anti muslim or anti christian. He is one of the few exceptions. Hindus , because of BJP will soon be labeled Terrorists and illiterates. The world will shun you , if hate against others So who wrote bhavadgita idiot. RSS? A misguided story .... I have many Pakistani Hindu friends here they never complained as he said always I see other pictures on social media and here this person he may just hate others so he just lying 🤥. And whatever he said the lines on Islam and Christianity it’s my true. This is what illiterate means some radicals  kill and its ok . but a hindu victim speaks its hindu nationalist. he righteously talking on minorities as sikhs/others. India have religion unrest bcz 14% muslim lives here, let muslim grew is west u will see same mess there He is wrong, i am also hardcore hindu but i don&#39;t have problem with any religion except islam, bcz Christian excepted reform unlike Muslims this videos shows that a common man on d street of India is more intelligent and more intellectual as compare to ppl who debate every day in tv studios. i have same opinion for india secularism.

Fuck this shit. Hahaga very funny i dont want to even waste my time to comment on this bulshit and also to those hu telling that religions are bad. Stop acusing culture and religions change yourself. When you do good thing people will do good things with you. hindu religion ko itna insecure hone ki jarurat nhi hai Agar sach me ye hindu nationalist ki soch hai . To isse ghatiya duniya me kis8 aur ki soch aur isse chhota aur zaleel koi ho hi nahi sakta. Ye to andh bhakti ho gyi.  Ye r.s.s ideology pr sirf follow krte hain. Jinhone islam air christianity ko badnam krne ki koshish kee hai. Ghalat verses aur ghalat quote krke. Bahot ghatiya soch hai. Sharm aani chahiye . Itni kyun phat ti hai jbke yahan hum shaant hain. Cham cha Matriarchal society  thought of this man are wrong either he is not aware or he just want to derogate islam for this thing also. Infact the condition of womens were downtrodden in our country much before the Islam came to India. Lol..ladki ched kr dikhata koi...Khuda tujhe dimaag de Amen. <br>Saare ladki chedne waale tumhare dhrm ke log saare rapist tumhare dhrm ke log chatt puja ho ya dushera ya ho diwali sirf ladki baazi krne jaane waale tumhare dhrm ke log ..100 saal ki budhiya ka yesterday gang rape tumhare bhai bandhuo ne kiya aur keh rhe ho devi :)))... bhool gye tulsidaas ji ne kya kha tha &quot;Shudr pashu sidr tan naari saar dand ke adhikari&quot;  maltab shudr padhu aur aurat sab dande maaro tabhi theek rehte hain....aur bhool gya ki duniya mein sabase jayda female infanticide feticide kha hota hai india mein ...aur keh rhe ho devi:))) .islam ne 1400 saal pehle hi female infanticide pe rok lga di hai aur rape ki saza to.tumhe pta hi hai aakhir kya kya deney kroge aur jhooth bologe ..is trah ki video se bs apna mazaak bna rhe ho. violence against hindu ia increasing day by day but admin is not hindu he is pseudo secular Proud to be a Hindu at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=5m26s\">5:26</a> <br>This why Muslims also should raise hands... he said women harassment came from islam...if it is that why many rapes happening are done by hindus in india...many islamic countries have negligible or zero rape cases in their country but coming to india many literally one a day atleast...and many we cant see...i think he is wrong..islam itself respects women giving them veil for their protection where no other man can see the girl except his husband if she married...offcourse now a days girls too are not obeying to those traditions of india ...look at the films now a days how disgusting they are..they make women half naked and call it style...this is what takes men more crazy...As there is a saying &quot;khaana hamareliye pehanna dusroon ke liye&quot;...this is what we call sometimes half knowledge very dangerous...likewise half naked is too dangerous as it takes men to next level of desires...our elders gave us good traditions but we are loosing them bringing shameless people in india like sunny ..last time i saw a news that nearly lakhs of people gone there to see sunny leon ...is this what we are..if we organised a program of matryots no body comes if some stupid porn star is coming every body run..is this what our leader fought for freedom...india is made of fight with british by both hindu-muslim-sikh-jain...india is everyones who fought for its freedom.. The Mind Of A White Liberal Paagal namuna he Propaganda at its best. Fucking commies This shows the mentality of rss and bjp people. I don&#39;t say they are wrong or good but I disagree with them completely. I grew up in a secular India and support a secular India not Hindu India. They claim to be nationalists but I believe they are working against nation. They have created a civil unrest since they came in power. Now frequency of Hindu and Muslims clashes have increased. I believe in Constitution of India which gives basic  rights to every citizen of India and no fucking Hindu or Muslim or a man/women from any religion to tell others what to do or what to eat or what to wear how to live where to live and so on. They even fool their own people by feeding them lies while fucking economy by poor implementation of laws. They believe in beating dalits as it is their birth right. Even bhagvadgita mentions so. Before commenting on scriptures of other religions please read your own first.  Also I need to tell this man that Ashoka was not Hindu he was follower  of Buddhism and also spreaded it in East. And they should read that how hindu&#39;s killed Buddhism in India by spreading lies and making their so called manusmriti. Hinduism and buddhist are best peaceful . Jahil hai ye purest form me. Anti Indian hai ye Make a video of a talibani and say &quot; the mind of a muslim&quot;  but i bet u guys wont do that,  while i being an atheist dont give a shit about religions but islamic bootlicking done by liberal media is obnoxious to say the least,... Partial truth .......But true I totally agree with him Truth said Islam se hi &quot;sati&quot; b aaya tha kya bc raja ram Mohan se phle widwaaon ko shade ka adikaar b nhi tha sanyas dilwaate the unko aur society se bahishkaar karwa te thae bc baate krte hou... ... Blaming Muslims for everything ..... Kya chutipyaapa hai... Rapistan Abrahamic religion followers and unrealized aethiests wont accept these things at all. Hindus are always open to accept their own loopholes. their scriptures are openly debated, telecasted and repeatedly told by  which are now open to any one. That means those who dont know ABC&#39;s of hinduism will debate about ancient scriptures. Other religion scriptures are not openly debated by rationalists. Hinduism is debated among rationalists. Islam is mostly debated by maulvis only and again they will fight with each other what is correct way of islam which embarasses common muslim man but they can do nothing than defend themselves.  No rationalist cannot speak about islam. First of all they don&#39;t call those as rationalists. They are apostates for them.<br><br>One thing is neither anyone have born with deciding religion. we are all product of our thoughts and actions. who knows if i have next life I may born as muslim or christian.. it doesnt matter but only we can wish is we all should be open to accept good and and also loopholes and upgrade ourselves because life is ever changing. If phone deserves to be upgraded, why not human life? This and the people commenting here have same thoughts.. Tatti Every single word of him is 💯 right. <br>I am a proud Hindu nationalist @Diplomat<br> When did you guys find a guy who lives in Modern  India with a stone age brain.......😁🤣???? jaahil saala Really why do u need to do an  interview with such a person full with some shitty ideas. U r giving that fool a false sense of importance by interviewing him on such a platform. this shit person has very less knowledge on scriptures of any religion.....watever he is trained to speak by RSS goons is speaking like parrot..... people like this same to India n humanity...lol I am surprised that this channel has 5k+ subscribers. And yes it should be called <a href=\"http://thecommunist.com/\">thecommunist.com</a>. Suits well. Bjp supporter hy ye E RSS wala bewaqoof ban hua hai Hahaha yeh ward hy hi nai Pakistan aa ja Quran says killing one human (no matter what religion) is equal to killing the whole humanity. And what you quoted was not for Hindus. May god bless you सबसे बडा जाहिल है ये ना अपने बारे में जानता ना ही दूसरे के बारे में जानता है Ye video to me pura bhi nahi dekh paya itna pagal gadha Ye to bahut badha wala gadha hai ye RSS ke school se padha hai isiliye gadha ban gya .rss ke school me kewal Muslim or sc st ke bacho ke sath bhedhbhao hota hai unka moral down kiya jata hai. remove diz video ASAP Apni book to padhi nhi dusro ki gyan de rha h Inki hisab se to ISIS Or terrorist bhi shi h HAR HAR MAHADEV Lolwut. Why don&#39;t they have the balls to come up and interview a real nationalist scholar, to actually know what it&#39;s about? Of course all of them just have to show nationalists and Hindus in a bad light. <br><br>It&#39;s sad that the Indic side still doesn&#39;t have a proper media narrative to counter such propaganda and ecosystem to force people to rewrite our proper history. Pledge your support to Indic Collective Trust, which is an initiative in this direction. Jai Shri Ram Read a book titled Hindus An Alternative History by Wendy Doniger to know real truth about Hinduism. Let the logic prevail. Who&#39;s religion is logical? I feel mine.  Right?  Similarly you feel yours. Bro every person feels same.<br><br>Aggression to enforce anyone&#39;s ideology shows deep rooted insecurity..........about our own beliefs. <br>Aggression is no confidence..... It&#39;s simply manifestation of insecurity. What to fear now and why? How can you forcefully influence belief of some one. Next generation would not stick to it...... they would revert back. Beliefs are enforced by heart and their own quality.  Point taken that many were forcefully converted to some believe system at a certain moment of history....... but what makes the later generations stick to what was forced upon their forefathers?<br>Actually in first instance believes are not forced upon..... trust and beliefs are built..... Built by winning the hearts ......Forget what ever media feeds.... Forget what is heard...... Forget what happens in outside world...... Check what happens with you...... What bad was done to you... To you as an individual at a personal level....... We have lived in peace and harmony since ages and will continue to do so.......

Ha mai b manta hu Hinduism me women ke saat boot acha vaihar... <br>Bus swamiji se malum hora hai... He is a simple example of extremist... Obviously in India political works takes time to get done but you can&#39;t take laws in your hand...and obviously his ideology for being Hindu is totally wrong... Hinduism teaches to accept everyone and work along with everyone from every background... Hinduism does never say other religions are any less... He is a brainwashed and really abused guy Probably someone should tell him, the biggest atrocities in the world are committed by elected govts not religions...excluding Islam though. RSS spreading the hatred, violence and dirty mindset. You have no right to use the name of the guru gobind singh he. Sikhism believed in the human brotherhood and war between the mughal empire and gurugobind singh je against barbaric regime not Islam. Islam is respected by the Sikhism but not hatred. You are hatemongers Hindus, if any Hindu who believes in the humanity is welcome. But nowadays everyone is full of the devilish behavior and giving logic Hahahah ek orat ko 5 mardo say shadi karni padi we ek mahila pardhan time tha or 1400 saal pehley RSS wale he to they bus india mai बचपन से ही चूतियों की टोली में रहे हो इसलिए ये सब सिखाया गया।। हमने भी बचपन बिताया है हमें तो सिखाया गया सब धर्म एक समान है सब धर्म का सम्मान करना चाहिए। भाई चारे से रहना चाहिए।<br><br>अच्छा बताओ हाफ पेंट पहन कर और डंटा भांजकर कवन सब हिन्दू धर्म बचा रहे हो तुम??

Another propaganda against Hindus and another way of turning the minorities against Hindus. Sharam karo yaar. This is great journalism, no screaming in front of cameras, no self righteousness, no arguments about political correctness. Just let the man speak, correct any sources  if he has claimed. This is what news reporting should be, let the audience decide if they agree with this guy&#39;s ideas or not, the job of journalist is only report not provide opinions. I support your view of thinking dont defame hindu nationalists its not good. Im a christian, and we have the americas and some parts of europe. Muslims have that shithole called the middle east, why can hindus have India?. Bankrupt mind. Religous Fanatic Jai Shri Uncle Sam. Just imagine if Christians in the US, Canada, Australia and Britain treated Hindus the same way Hindus treat Christians in India. Do a Hindu have a fucking brain?

TheDiplomat: Seriously? This is what you folks choose to publish? It’s despicable how you pick a nobody, put up a disclaimer and post a video on YouTube, clearly when the video is meant to instigate anti-secular sentiments. Brainwashed hindu extremist Now that&#39;s  what is called  misconception..   There are some so called islamist, like this man in the video. But Islam is always about peaceful  solutions. Who is this uneducated idiot? I personally condemn  people with such a mentality. Whatever religion he has to follow it&#39;s his wish but atleast he shouldn&#39;t criticise others. All of the people know the reality.....all knows there&#39;s only one god whom we can&#39;t imagine how he looks like.....we can&#39;t say to a human that he is god because if he is like us then why he is not diffrent then us and he did all those things that we use to do...in hinduism there&#39;re 2 million gods who look like us. . . . . and some are imaginary .....in Christianity they think Jesus Christ (pbuh) is god but he is just a prophet....in bhudhiesm they believe gautam bhudh is god.......in islam they believe only one god ......there&#39;s no picture of god..........how you can imagine god .........? The brain that u r using is given by him ...you can&#39;t imagine Right I proud to be a Hindu हर हर महादेव 🔱आज हम सब को समझना चाहिए की मुसलमान आज वही कर रहे जो क़ुरान में लिखा है। वे बर्मा में भी आतंक फैला रहे हैं और बहुत सारे हिन्दुओ को मा रहे हैं। मुसलमान जहां भी जाते हैं मेहमान बन के जाते लेकिन उसके बाद वे अपना हक़ मांगने लग जाते है। सिरिया से भी जो मुसलमान यूरोप वगैर जा रहें हैं वो कुछ सालों बाद अपना हक़ मांगने लगेंगे और तीसरा विश्वयुद्ध इन के ही कारण होने वाला है। इससे जाहिर है कि हमको अपना भारत इनसे बचाना होगा।में आप सब से अनुरोध करता हूँ कि आप सब 2019 के चुनावों में भी मोदी को अपना वोट देकर जिताएं। केजरू और राहुल जैसे चुतियो को तो सिर्फ सत्ता चैहिये और इसके लिए वो तो ओवैसी के जूते भी चाटना शुरू कर देंगे। 🇮🇳 Half of the fact stated by the person are lies and fake.This explains why when people start understanding religion from so called priest,sadhus or molwis(in reality people seeking power) Extremist ideologies are given birth.This thing is in every religion Christianity, Muslim s, hindus,even Buddhism.People should understand their religion by themselves and not get manipulated by others. seriously mentally sick This anchor is pseudo secular.

The Bible has two main books The old testament and the New testament....what he said about the stone punishment is in old testament which is not linked with Jesus Christ...Jesus Christ  is In the new testament he teaches love and peace and non violence....So this man dosent have the knowledge of bible....If you read the bible as a book you all will learn about. History of mankind its very interesting..... well said... Dunya mai Hindu ek aisa dharam hai ke jis mai ashanti hai. Jo dharam jaap paat mai bata ho wo jaa ke ab Islam ko gali detey hai ke dunya mai ashanti ka karan Islam hai. Pehley to bhai khud apney gireban mai zara jaank ke deko os ke baad Islam ka naam lo.

This is clearly a petro dollar funded content aimed at maligning the Hindus and Indians. It is actually not our Hinduism, our India!! Our India needs to be strong, inclusive(no tolerant but friendly and assimilative), developed, diverse, rational and incredible What else can one expect from a person schooled in RSS school.. such a petty .. such a ignorance... Shouldn&#39;t politicians work right irrespective to who call them!!! Anarchy in making This video depicts how a hindu nationalist thinks, about Islam and Christianity, there is nothing wrong in it , its his will and his teaching from his house and school what made him believe.  We all are Indians and we all should live in harmony , why criticising others feeling , others relaligion , other eating , other thinking, like him....... who are you to question . And please thing wise and comment reasonably When it comes to bullshit you have to stand in awe of the all time heavy weight champion of bullshit - Religion. No contest.<br><br>- George Carlin wht solution do u hav? does he get a toilet ？ I think this link has been shared by so called liberals, who are lobbying here, just to dislike it.<br>I won&#39;t be surprised if dislikes win over  ha ha <br>p.s one of the best videos in my list. simple truth personally chut ka dakkan h ye that person is saying that Muslim has made mosque on every street of uttar pradesh....and asking for reservation upto 20% ( TWENTY PERCENT SOCHNE WALI BAAT HAI) although and if they are getting beaten then he doesn&#39;t found any wrong in this crime.. then he must have been supporting the dalits who are getting  scolded and beaten because they are enjoying reservation.... such a shame on you.. and admin  you call them nationalist<br>.. no man they are not nationalist they are threat to nationalism... and why I can say that because I come from the veterans( army)  family whose member are serving India keeping their life on their palm.. Maybe he has some valid points , but his outlook of us vs them would either lead to genocide of minorities or eternal strugggle between the  factions <br><br>And mind you even if the rss manage to get rid of all the Muslims on India , <br><br>They won’t go home and go on with their lives they would need some other group to target , it won’t be long since they would start target folds inside Hindi religion itself आज के समय में किसी भी धर्म के लोग दूध के धुले नहीं हैं। जो सिर्फ अपने समुदाय को अच्छा कहे, और दूसरो के समुदाय को बुरा वो सबसे बड़ा मूर्ख है। तुमने कहा कि भारत वासियों ने लड़की छेड़ना मुसलमानो के आने से सीखा। मै पूछना चाहता हूँ कि पनघट पर गोपियों को  छुप छुपकर कंकर मारने कौन जाता था। सीता जी को अपहरण करके ले जाने वाला रावण किस धर्म को मानता था। और मैं आप को बता दूं कि रामायण के हिसाब से दुराचारी रावण शिव का भक्त था। तथा सति प्रथा के अनुसार स्त्रियों को जिंदा जलाने वाले कौन थे।और पाँच पांडव अपनी पत्नी की इतनी ही इज्जत करते थे तो उन्होंने अपनी पत्नी को जुए की बाजी में क्यों लगाया। शायद उन्होंने इसलिए लगाया क्योंकि उनके लिए उनकी पत्नी एक वस्तु थी। Modi bhakt h, inka purana funda h ki pehle logon ko musalmano se darao or phir bjp Ko maseeha banao iski chakal dekho cow ka pishab peene wala lagta hai आधी खोपडी है इसकी...कुछ भी बक रहा है ☺ Why haven&#39;t you interviewed Muslims and Christians or ppl other religion(minorities) <br>Trying to spoil image of Hindus??<br>Are you really Diplomats 🙄 aap number ek chutiya he sir. bachpan me maa baap ki baat maan kar kaas thoda padh liya hota aapne tho sahi rehta. really sorry for you sir.

Are you going to call &#39;Khalsa Panth&#39; a terror organization. They were forced to defend their life and culture. Other side is aggressive and if you don&#39;t posture yourself, you shall be Arabized. Do you see Hindus prospering in Pakistan or Bangladesh, like Muslims do in India? Other parties talk about Gujarat riots, do they talk why it happened? Why it&#39;s not a news when Hindus are killed in Kashmir? Why should majority by always apologitic.  A crime is a crime, done by either. Iski galti nahi hai isne jo seekha hai RSS se wahi bola hai my ancestors were forced out of Pakistan and were also given only two choices , either to convert to Islam or to leave the country . islam is the most corrupt religion . bc chootiyeeee sale tum ganwar ho ganwar hi rahogy all rss n bjp ganwar ho woi rahogy or kya bola bay tu k islam k ane se logo ne jahalat seeki acha chl ye bata k sati-pratha phir kyo theee ye to hmare islam me hai naai abeee tm jaise soch wale logo ko pakistan me hi rehna chiyeee thaaa <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23IAmproudtobeamuslim\">#IAmproudtobeamuslim</a> or kya bola tu k bjp k sarkar rahegi dhek lena is baar kya hota hai election me he ram me ek Hindu hu aur o b c cast ka hu bihar ka hu Bihar gay tha cast sartifecat mangga tho thara tha ra me kanun batha k bhaga dea na padhai dang se hui upar se dil ki bimari bhi ho gai hart diesis na nukri na mehanth majduri ka kaam kar sakta hu na digri hai AB ek din sarkaar se binti karungga ki ekcha mrittu Dede tera ram g karenge beda paar udasi maan kahe ko dare This is mind of Muslim thinker that  Hindu think like that.

Har har mahadev man the propaganda they teach at shishu Mandir is real!....I had this teacher who was a student of shishu Mandir and really has cancerous view about everything,but then I thought it was an one off case but now I can see the design People of the world don’t look at themselves, and so they blame one another ~ Maulana Jallaludin Rumi Sick. @The Diplomat<br>Bravo! Get a not-so-smart person supporter and portray him as the face of an ideology. Real mature journalism. Why don&#39;t you try talking to a ISIS supporter and call the video, the voice of a Muslim. May be this man poor in gk . Hindus has been suffered from many centuries, we are in majority but we have been and are real victims of the invaders and bigoted government.we are not white in america, indian liberal media learns leftism from the western institution and books and apply on India. Indian media should stop treating like hindus like american media treats white.<br><br>Biased tradition like polygamy used to exist in both religion. Hindus has welcomed the law of one spouse but not muslim.Make legal for both male and female to have multiple partner if they all agree with each-other. On the name of religion you can not give special rights to perticular minorities speacially when those practices and harm other minority&#39;s way of living.<br><br>No public loudspeaker should be allowed in between <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a> am to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m00s\">6:00</a> am for all religion whether its navaratri or azan.<br><br>Supreme court and biased constitution is destroying hindu tradition and pamparing 1400 years old muslim tradition. <br><br>There are many muslim country,<br>.

If you really want to know you should read it rather than listening from others...<br>Bible never says what you are talking about but Bible says in:-<br>Mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=12m30s\">12:30</a>-31New International Version (NIV) :-<br>30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.”<br><br>Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=5m44s\">5:44</a>New King James Version (NKJV)<br>44 But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you,[a]<br><br>These are the words of JESUS my friend You are the one spreading hate in the hearts of people. Nowhere in the Bible is it written to kill or stone anyone if they don&#39;t follow Christ. Everyone is allowed to follow and worship the God of thier choice as per thier intellect and understanding. Please don&#39;t spread hatred. Jai Shree Ram Wow I support him 100% even though I am an Atheist. Enough of Muslim appeasement in India &amp; conversions by Christian missionaries. This is real fact 👆👆👆 aapne peheli line bilkul sahi kahi. Bada murkh insan lagta hai ye insan... Have you ever read history???do you know the satidah pratha....jaha bacche bacche Karki Ko unki Budha husband k sath jalaya ja ta tha..you have also know knowledge nothing about Quran...I  also hated indian Muslim...I am a litterate person...and after reading Quran I realize that Islam is solution for the whole of humanity....and I accept Islam...and became a Muslim...but again I hate indian Muslim....they also don&#39;t know nothing about Quran...they don&#39;t read it by understanding..and that is the problem...just like you...indian ,Pakistan Muslim don&#39;t follow the true Islam which is mentioned in the holy Quran....I am a concerted indian Muslim ...and I know the truth behind all the problem...that we are facing....you are challenging Islam ...but you haven&#39;t ever read the Quran by understanding... there is no relation between Islam and cow....even Muslim don&#39;t know about it... that&#39;s why there is a lots of  misunderstanding between us....I am requesting every peaple  plz plz read the Quran by  understanding... because Quran is revealed by god for every mankind...every man can get the right way from Quran... Sari bate sahi thi inki salute you sir This guy does not represent Hinduism Brainwashed ... if islam and christianity (over 3 billion adherents)  was evil and preached whatever he is claiming ..... this world would ve ended long back . Its easy to preach hate chai ke nukkad par baith kar . Is it not an interviewer&#39;s role to be impartial. Yet for every reasoning or logic the person was giving, you were only interested in giving a counterpoint. Have you ever thought why in first place world over there is a negative image of Islam. RSS doesnt have influence in Europe or North America. Societies and nations which follow strict Islam are some of the most intolerant towards women and minorities.  In case you truly champion liberal beliefs, you are doing a disservice to your cause by being dogmatic and prejudiced against right wing opinions. Christian proselytisation and slander campaigns of right wing Hindu groups, Muslim appeasement are the reasons. In West Bengal, the state govt puts restrictions on Durga Puja festivities in the name of law and order but will go out of the way to appease Muslims. When India gained independence centuries old traditional laws were set aside for a common civil code for Hindus, even though Hindus across the country are very different fro, each other in their social norma, but yet 70 years down the line there is no common civil code for Muslims. Isnt this partiality. Temples are directly run under govt administratiom, but mosques arent. Abe ja chutiye....jhoot na bol....paise kha he baitha hai... Another modi bhakt Gaandhi vad need desh ko khokhala kar Diya , psuedo secularism gaandhi ki den h you say liberal muslim... sir can you name me 3 muslim majority secular country What he told are aspirations of common people....<br>How does Hindu nationalism come into this..???? Great jai shree ram सीमा लांघ गए आप तो नीचता में Good work. Ab ekbaar sunni muslims ka mind bhi cover karlo. Ki nahin karoge ? I agree with him... that&#39;s a nice interview.... Religion with state is total mess and if u want to see it plz visit India once in ur life time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23incredibileindia\">#incredibileindia</a> Which chapter of the Hindu Scriptures say &quot;You shall lynch anyone who kills a cow&quot;? If it&#39;s not written anywhere, then why do the incidents happen? We need to except that there&#39;s a doctored version of &quot;Hinduism&quot; which is as orthodox as mainstream islam or Christianity. The real hinduism (Sanatana Dharma) is long dead, and today hinduism is as shallow as any other irrrational religion. In mordern context, I see no diffrence between Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. It&#39;s all about levels of orthodoxy. The reality is, Hinduism gives you freedom to be a seeker. It doesnot forces upon you the tenets of scriptures (You are free to create your own philosophy), but the orthodox hindus of the mordern age have blurred the original essence of &quot;Indian Philosophy&quot; and succumbed to the shallowness of &quot;bad-faith&quot; Wtf fucking narrow minded moron man Show mind of a Muslim you will come to know who is worse amongst all Sahi baat Jai Shree RAM It seems fake.. Again you can&#39;t make Modi government failure in the name of religion...  Worst prime minister India ever had by the records of GDP and job cuts.. economy is now in the deep well..

This Gentleman has know knowledge of any religion and just defending its own Wow guys. Way to go for a secular country. Jai hind. when we will begin to learn that we are human first!

Kya Bakwas he is saying When this person says something about Christianity or Islam , its is displayed that it is unsubstantiated claim but as soon the marriage of draupadi is termed as polyandry under matriarchal society, suddenly the channel is sure about it not being so, which may not be proven yet but is logical, what kind of bias premeditated journalism is this, preposterous. you have successfully widen the gap between hindus and Muslims by posting\\u200b this video ...<br>keep it up .... Hinduism is garbage Seems reasonable Indian fault lines..... Game gona be more interesting... Hegel&#39;s law going to be true soon.. The level of stupidity in the video doesn’t surprises me what does is the stupidity of  the people in comments section What kind of stupif propaganda is this to defame Hindu ideology?

Views of one person doesnt represent every else&#39;s हर हर महादेव जय श्री राम Whatever he said everything is true... He is right Whatever he&#39;s saying is &quot;The Truth&quot;... hinduism says ( sarv dharma samabhaav ) all religions are equal, this man contradicts that, obviously he doesn&#39;t follow hinduism. Christians are nonvoilent in INDIA andmodt aprt of world jis dharam m Dalito par Atyachar hota hai wo dharam kitna shanti wala hai ...<br>jis dharam m mahilao par sati ka atyachar hoa hai ....<br><br>wo dharam kaisa hai He is very accurate. Islam and christianity are anti human and anti hindu. I have lots of hindu friends and i spends my 12 hours with them daily. But their thinking is just opposite to this man cause&#39; they learn Hinduism from their parents not from school run by rss. The Great Bharatbarsh Modi Failed in every aspects....

Christians are the most peaceful people in this world!🙄 Kisi Bhai ke paas agar jawab Hain to please ...I am waiting <br>1:- सभी देवी देवताओ ने भारत मे हि जन्म क्यो लिया? क्यो किसी भी देवी देवता को भारत के बाहर कोइ नही जानता ?\\t2:- जितने भी देवी देवता देवताओ की सवारीया है उनमे सिर्फ वही जानवर क्यो है जो कि भारत मे ही पाये जाते है? एसे जानवर क्यो नही जो कि सिर्फ कुछ हि देशो मे पाये जाते है, जैसे कि कंगारु, जिराफ आदी !!\\t3:- सभी देवी देवता हमेशा राज घरानो मे हि जन्म क्यो लेते थे ? क्यो किसी भी देवी देवता ने किसी गरीब या शुद्र के यहा जन्म नही लिया?\\t? 4:- पोराणीक कथाओ मे सभी देवी देवताओ की दिनचर्या का वर्णन है जैसे कि कब पार्वती ने चंदन से स्नान किया, कब गणेश के लिये लड्डु बनाये, गणेश ने कैसे लड्डु खाये.. आदी लेकीन जैसे हि ग्रंथो कि स्क्रीप्ट खत्म हो गयी भगवानो कि दिनचर्या भी खत्म.. तो क्या बाद में सभी देवीदेवताऔ का देहांत हो गया ??\\t6:- जब भी कोइ पापी पाप फैलाता था तो उसका नाश करने के लिये खुद भागवान किसी राजा के यहा जन्म लेते थे फिर 30-35 की उम्र तक जवान होने के बाद वो पापी का नाश करते थे, ऐसा क्यों? पापी का नाश जब भगवान खुद हि कर रहे है तो 30-35 साल का इतना ज्यादा वक्त क्यो??? भगवान सिधे कुछ क्यो नही करते?? जीस प्रकार उन्होने अपने खुद के ही भक्तो का उत्तराखण्ड मे नाश किया ?\\t(8) अगर हिन्दू धर्म के अनुसार एक जीवित पत्नी के रहते, दूसरा विवाह अनुचित है, तो फिर राम के पिता दशरथ ने चार विवाह किस नीति अनुसार किये थे?\\t(9) अगर शिव के पुत्र गनेश की गर्दन शिव ने काट दी, तो फिर यह कैसा भगवान है?? जो उस कटी गर्दन को उसी जगह पर क्यों नहीं जोड़ सका?? क्यों एक पिरपराध जानवर (हाथी) की हत्या करके उसकी गर्दन गणेश की धढ पर लगाई? एक इंसान के बच्चे के धढ़ पर हाथी की गर्दन कैसे फिट आ गयी?\\t(10) अगर हिन्दू धर्म में मांसाहार वर्जित है, तो फिर राम स्वर्णमृग (हिरन) को मारने क्यों गए थे? क्या मृग हत्या जीव हत्या नहीं है?<br>5:- ग्रंथो के अनुसार पुराने समय मे सभी देवी देवताओ का पृथ्वी पर आना-जाना लगा रहता था। जैसे कि किसी को वरदान देने या किसी पापी का सर्वनाश करने.. लेकीन अब एसा क्या हुआ जो देवी देवताओ ने पृथ्वी पर आना बंद हि कर दिया??\\t(7) अगर हिन्दू धर्म कई हज़ार साल पुराना है, तो फिर भारत के बाहर इसका प्रचार-प्रसार क्यों नहीं हुआ और एक भारत से बाहर के धर्म “इस्लाम-ईसाई” को इतनी मान्यता कैसे हासिल हुई? वो आपके अपने पुरातन हिन्दू धर्म से ज़्यादा अनुयायी कैसे बना सका? हिन्दू देवी-देवता उन्हें नहीं रोक रहें??\\t(11) राम अगर भगवान है, तो फिर उसको यह क्यों नहीं पता था कि रावण की नाभि में अमृत है? अगर उसको घर का भेदी ना बताता कि रावण की नाभि में अमृत है, तो उस युद्ध में रावण कभी नहीं मारा जाता। क्या भगवन ऐसा होता है?\\t(12) तुम कहते हो कि कृष्ण तुम्हारे भगवन हैं, तो क्या नहाती हुई निर्वस्त्र गोपीयों को छुपकर देखने वाला व्यक्ति, भगवान हो सकता है? अगर ऐसा काम कोई व्यक्ति आज के दौर में करे, तो हम उसे छिछोरा-नालायक कहते हैं। तो आप कृष्ण को भगवान क्यों कहते हो?\\t(13) हिन्दूओ में बलात्कारीयोंका प्रमाण अधिक क्यों होते हैं?\\t(15) खुजराहो के मंदिरों में काम-क्रीड़ा और उत्तेजक चित्र हैं, फिर ऐसे स्थान को मंदिर क्यों कहा जाता है? क्या काम-क्रीडा, हिन्दू धर्मानुसार पूजनीय है?

Liberal Muslims are the spokesperson for Wahhabis bloddy  things is people just talk about religion Bala Bala <br>I don&#39;t think so any person or religion is perfect without humanity <br>Every body on our country to live with freedom and equality in our India , no any one above among human mahadev I&#39;m an Indian Atheist, I completely agree with him. Hindus along with Buddhists and  SIkhs have the first right over India because they are the Natives. Why should Hindus adapt to Islam or Christianity which are foreign ideologies that came to India through Colonization and Islamic Jihad (Conquests by Arabs, Turks and Afghans) ?<br><br>Hindus who are natives of the land, deserve the right to decide who stays or leaves in India, What food to eat and What Laws to follow, Its their Nation after-all, They lived here thousands of years even before Jesus or Muhammad. <br><br>Do you see Muslims forcing their beliefs and Culture on Majority in Catholic Ireland ?<br>Do you see Hindus forcing their beliefs and Culture on Majority in Saudi Arabia ?  Of course not..<br><br>Hindus have every right to decide what they want and how India should be in the Future !!! If you think this is wrong, The fault is with your thinking, Not the reality !!! The reality is for thousands of years, People identify with a certain culture and Nation and are proud of it, Nothing wrong with this !!! Who are you to deny them this right ? islamist jab kaafir (non -muslim) ko bomb se udate hai tab video kyu nahi banate This guy don&#39;t have any knowledge but let&#39;s forgive him because he is a victim that&#39;s why now he his complaining about all other religion . As he mentioned before that during partition he was forced to leave Pakistan because of some cruel acts committed by local people who were Muslims but all people are not alike . I also do not have problem from Brahman, I have problem from brahmanyawad See the  mind set of  RSS what kind of national they are .  The main policy of Rss is divided and rules.   Now Every  days they got  success  in there policy . he is not thinking clearly .too much brainwashed by bullshit .the answer doesnot lie in the past .the answer lies in creating a new future in which human values are the base, not extremism . these guy is so uneducated..saying bible wrote by constantine..plz dude go n do some research show me which version in bible says stone to ur brother if he doesnt believe in christianity...infact bible says love ur neighbour as urself..dont leave ur wife even if she is nonvbeliever..i think these people never read bible..just making statements likha hai (pataa nahi ..pa likha hai)....isne bola maine manaa......abe jaa ke khud dekho ...study it........phir jis dharm ko gaali deni hai do.........its ur personal choice.......bhai main kisi g__duu ki bolbacchan me nahi aunga.......kyunki main g__ndu nahi hoon ...main jo dekhta hu usu par bharosa karta hu........its called................L FOR......LOGIC....not........Lo__. bhaiyon apna dimaag lagao use apni.........G___D ME DAL KAR CHUTIYAPA MAT SOCHO. did u guys ever thought of making a video titled &quot;The mind of Muslim Extremist&quot;....!!! Ravan came before, muslims 😂😂😂<br><br>Agyanta 😪 Too much brainwashed Islam is that cancer which feeds on the peace in Earth. I m from Punjab Pakistan and that partition of India was biggest blunder in modren world where so many peoples became homeless in their own country.even after 70 years peoples still feel it Forgot to mention that I am a Christian and I have lot of Hindu and Muslim friends but we respect each other and do not make fun of each others believe and teaching even though it feels like funny or nonsense. I accept it as their believe and faith they also do the same to each other and to me. He mentioned how Trump and others win election but forgot how Modi won the election..he told Quran and Bible teaches to hate other religions and is full of nonsence but he tactfully skipped to mention in which part of Bible it is mentioned.<br>And for his kind info Bible is not a book written by a king or ruler but it is a combination 66 book which includes scriptures from Hebrew, Greek and Aramite and was written by 40 people from different era and stages and there is a timeline of 1600 years in completion. It was translated to English by King James which he mentioned.The main point to mention here is that when these books combined together it says only one thing there is only one ulimate God and all should workship in his name. Yes it clearly states not to go after several man made God&#39;s but never teaches to stone them to death....Pls stop spreading such type of rationalist venom to the society and keep your believe within you and try to correct false tinking of other religions. If one try to find out which is the most unreliable and fake religion it will bounce back to you... Let me quote Manu smriti in this context.

Both have killed Hindus ...and conversion is still going on because of the unsatble Hindu society and families...more leftist and atheist are born in Hindu families..secularism is good..but the majority have rights too.. I agree , there are verses in Holy Bible and Quran that talks about showing disrespect and violence towards other religions.. But Hinduism was always tolerance and love..

When there are multiple problems in the country like GDP going below 4, unemployment, businesses going downhill etc., this guy is in his own uncivilised and hateful world. He&#39;s a shame on the ethos of this pure land and Hinduism which promotes nothing but love and compassion. Meeting point , K.G marg He is not wrong! Hail Hindutva.

First you need to go some primary school to learn how to talk you can’t just come up with your own opinions which even doesn’t make sense. My friend 75% indian  doesn’t have toilet 🚽 .so as I said no religion no law first make sure you know something about your self or just don’t talk. totally wrong....no Hindu nationalist thinks like this...a Hindu nationalist is one who is against the person who stands against the motherland...even if it&#39;s a Hindu....hindu according to sangh and veda is one who believes this country hindusthan as his own motherland....simple and easy hindu o ko minority hone se bachana hai toh BJP ko support karo...

Vote bank politics should end. Government offices should function better and be proud of the culture you come from. And one more from history it is evident that the violent religions are Islam and Christianity which caused many wars and deaths. In educational institutions a muslim guy or gal can be allowed to wear their religious outfits instead of dress code  but not others allowed to do so, what is this ? This is proof that burden of secularism is only on the shoulders of non- muslims. Christianity dushman se bhi pyar karne ki hidayat deti hei.

No need to put such things on other religion make your religion strong and beautiful you need not to fight anyone in name of religion Only problem with Hindu Nationalist is when there is attack from outside they start to cry we are hindu .This hindustan is our we are 80% of Indian pouplation . But on  normal days , there are  22% SC 6 % ST we dont touch  42 % OBC 10 % others  you are lower . We 20% general are real representative of Hinduism . We dont let you to come above in Social Strucutre  you have to born again .You are Hindu but we dishonour you ,you are not us general . As Hindu you need to come to temple but we do not let you to communicate with God directly you need us ...who the hell are you to come between me and my god !! Thing do not stop here we do not let women to enter they are lower than us ..how a lower lady give birth to General man and he become Superior to All ....this all is crap .. You want to say Hindu Nationalist first remove this caste system  and see what beautiful effect it will create . Real Hinduism is such a beautiful thing that youi need not to fight . Every muslim near by will change to Hinduism not by force  but by beauty of Hinduism ....Hope somebody put sense in RSS and VHP guys .Not only this when 80% hindu say in one voice whole world will hear we will be power not by harrshing any one .....

I don&#39;t know why but us,South Asians have pledged to stay a few decades behind the west. We always play with the ideas that didn&#39;t work with them. It&#39;s a curse on us that we have a limited vision. strategically targeted an individual common rss follower, who is not aware of the aftereffects of this so called  interview, which is conveniently edited as per your need.... what an @$$hole journalist you are.!!! shame on you. look at nations that took religion to extreme form democracy they will fall, fate will be like Siya.  and next generation will survive without any religions The Diplomate, instead of showing views of believers on their books to counter the view of this person, Why don’t u show the verses from the book. <br><br><br>Why don’t u show the truth of Bible n Quran and a ask a simple question that why an Almighty God needs a book or a son or a prophet in only one region and in only one langauge? Kaun hai ye gadhe ka baccha ?? only Islam and Christianity have verse that give examples of killing babies n women of non-believers in barbaric ways. Only Islam and Christianity ask Non-believers to be converted through threat, violence, love or other means to convert Only Islam and Christianity follow division of huamnity between believers and non-believers f ing BACKWARD People.religion lol lol I am a Kashmiri pandit and I&#39;m ashamed of people like him who ignore everything that is wrong with Hinduism itself..and blame all social evils on Islam and Christianity.. We are not against Muslims &amp; Christians. we are against Conversion of Hindus by any mean. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrxW7n73C7s&amp;t=6m34s\">6:34</a> dude Pakistan is on tenth position in human unrest index because there only Muslims and now they are butchering their own muslim citizens. Sikhs were killed by people who all belonged to one religion or dharma. christians do not punish or kill those adopt other religions nor anything or nothing is written in the bible to that effect.  Give up this false propaganda.  Get your facts right. he is talking the truth.... Hindu nationalism is a reaction to substantial pro-Muslim and pro-Christian policies, under the table, carried out by Congress and other regional parties. No anyone religious teach us hate to each other, it is divided by politicians and some religious scholars.thanks! He is bloody zombie product of Saraswati Shishu mandir. Nationalism is just bullshit for these people. They don&#39;t respect Indians they just want to let their frustration out through Hindutva. Being a Hindu Nationalist or a Jihadi is actually the same thing. Both of them want to let out their jealousy, failure and frustrations through these extremist ways. Losers go for violence and successful people want peace. He was 1000 times better than Muslim extremists in all over the world. Muslims are not problem but their ideology which force them to slit someone throat .<br> and keep woman under burqua and consider them only as a sexual object. problem is their law which they think written by god Diplomat is acting like the mind of a Hindu Nationalist is a specimen to observe. Excuse me... There are scholars whom you can interview WITH RESPECT.<br>This so called interview is sheer disrespect to Hindus. Konsi dunia mai rehta hai yeh chootiya HE IS A DISGRACE TO HINDUISM AND DOESNT UNDERSTAND IT. These are your views which are mostly factually wrong. <br>The invent of harassment is a modern concept which has no roots in Islam Hindu or Christianity. <br>The way of life in all three differs in some aspect but the overall msg seems the same.<br>To respect other religions. To love and nourish. The invent of God is a fearing concept in most religion to keep people from having fear from a diety. That his or her bad karma will be punished. <br>No religion knows anything about the existence of God. As is evident from this world being 5 billion years old. A mere 10 thousand years of human civilization. 9 thousand years of those had no method to verify the texts written. <br>If I tell you that God came in my mind to say there should be no religion. No one would believe me. But this same thing if written by a 2000 year old Saint is the truth of life. <br>To cling to a way of life is ones own choice when they have need a helping hand. But when you want people to just use your hand to go about their life. Want to cut other such hands. And wants people who don&#39;t need your helping hand to cling to it. The concept seems as ridiculous as it can be. Abe chutiye Tune kudh k Dhram Granth Padhe hai kya ?  <br>Aur haan naa koi muslim hun or naa koi christian hun.<br>Kudh Toh dhram pad le chutiya phale ? <br>Tera Dhram hi toh tika hua hai Superstitions And Caste Discrimination and Pakhandwaad par. chutiya feku, don&#39;t have enough knowledge about any religion scripts What a shitty translation! Mind wash makes violation I have seen muslims now Hindus too it means future is in trouble.<br>Where there is religion, no peace exist. i bet u find me out that quran says..&quot;kisi ka rasta roko&quot; u can just spread hate He may be a &quot;Hindu Nationalist&quot;  by western dictionary\\u200b but he only represents himself.<br>It&#39;s true that we felt a bit ashamed about his world view. But,<br> It&#39;s like I&#39;m interviewing a Abrahamic cult to know the shape of the universe who himself stuck between Jesus and gravity.<br> The Diplomat is trying hard to be the next aljajeera. This diplomat channel is quite biased. Not showing the full picture..... Ye rss wale sabse bade dushman hain. Hindu muslim karalo inse. Religion is basis of a state. Israel used Judaism, Rome used christianity, Arabs used Islam, Japan used buddism. India used Hinduism, communists used aethiesm. Religion is opium of masses. They train, exited &amp; leave them loose on other religions. Since god didn&#39;t have sale deed to any country people invented the religion in the name of so-called god to create a country. That&#39;s how &amp; why every country promotes state religion. saabas mere vai aap ko sunke acha laga Sahi kaha bhai tumne. Rss zindabad.. This man is free to voice his opinion which is his right , but that doesnot mean what he is saying is correct .<br><br>All religious text books have verses that are open to interpretation , where things go wrong is when humans use those verses as justification to villify others . There is NO bigger religion than HUMANITY which all holy books teach , yet this most important lesson of all hasn&#39;t yet been learned by humans . <br><br>I am a Indian first and then a sikh and for me every human being of the world deserves that same love and respect till the time he/she hurts someomeone else because of some arrogant/ignorant belief. He/she will be, as much a culprit as people who propogate hate and hatred on communal grounds which this man borderline propogates !! In religious unrest graph, most of the countries are muslims dominated. wow He is not entirely wrong. Islam does recommend killing non-believers. Religious unrest in 2015:  Majority are Islamic Countries. Another Christian missionaries funded news  magazine anti India propaganda.<br>Shame on you fucking media trying to show India in negative way. Hindus r brainwashed by rss and other extremists......india has to stop it ye admi isis ke kaam ko sahi bol rha h He said everything RIGHT ! Muslims and Islam is the source of all problems ! Christianity is an issue as well ! Jis jis ke paas thodi si samajh hai woh samajh sakta hai. Mughal rajaon ne kafi kuchh banaya; aaj se bada tha Bharat un dino.  Agar ye sach hota ke Hinduon ko mara gaya Muslims dwara to aaj Muslims 80% aur Hindu 20% hote magar sachchai to ulat hai.Aaj Hindu 80% aur Muslims 20% hain.Please sachchai ko age badhao aur jhoot ko joota <a href=\"http://maro.ye/\">maro.Ye</a> hamare beech dushmani phailane wale logon ki jam ke dhulai karo.JAI HIND!!! Blame game is a part of our ego defense mechanism Terror inside human mind become terrorist,religion dosent matter for it.remedy is to know THE TRUTH fully with inbiased mind n heart. vulgarity ,nudity , porn in the name of open society,toxic drink to relax stressed mind , poverty , illiteracy, unemployment,catatrophic currupt ion leading huge economic inequality due to crony capitalism r the cause disorderly state humanity.remedy is to know THE TRUTH n set  free bring back his moral principles back into society, be only a true human,not divide by religion, caste, Political party even by in the name of nation Jitni irsya is vyakti ke dimag me Islam aur Christian&#39;s ke bare me ha woh iske dimag ko bachpan se  train kiya aisa lagta ha..ye Jo bhi kah raha ha woh sab rss ka failaya jhoot ha.. agar ye kisi bhi ved ko pad le to pakka ek insan ban sakta aise gun is admi me lagte ha... Isse kuch bhi malumaatnahi hai...... tota hai beta jo padha hai Sick Mind. Merkel muslim refugee let hai This man is not an Indian. Constantine never wrote Bible. This man is just a blind Bhaktas. This man does not no History. Shame on such pseudo Indians. I am ashmed as a Hindu to hear such an interview. I differ from this guy completely Hindus are being brainwashed by their media &amp; officials <br>Stop it or you will suffer a lot He is wrong about Christianity. I&#39;m an Indian Hindu and I love Christianity. Islam is no As a an ex Christian I fully agree with this man, the Catholics and the Pentecosts go around mass converting the illiterate and the poor but I&#39;m glad it&#39;s mostly non violent, Islamists on the other hand need to be put down like a rabid dog.  Nothing but utter chaos and flith wherever they go. where there is written in Bible to stone and Constantine wrote Bible LOL please read about Bible. Then speak illetrate. the guy is talking about lessons learned from forceful persecution of natives by foreign islamist raiders......when state doesn&#39;t take proactive measures, it should be right of every citizen to take required proactive steps..... Originally he not hindu, but mushlaman WHAT ever this man said is out of ignorance he is miss informed about his own religion where it is written any body who kills a cow kills HINDU drama so killing such a man is good to appease gods. <br>ALL RELIGIONS &amp; their gods ARE made by  us GOD does not made HUMANITY. SO LET PEOPLE THINK RATIONALLY AND FK ALL  RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHIES BE GOOD HUMAN BEING LOVE &amp; HELP  EACHOTHER.  EVEN PROMOTE INTER RELIGIOUS &amp; CASTE MARRIAGES. I don&#39;t like religious intolerance,however, Hinduism and other Eastern religions have never imposed their beliefs on anyone the way that the Abrahamic religions have. very well said....that&#39;s why muslims from other countries r continuously entering in indian illegaly &amp; our population is growing high, muslim should not be provided with all facilities in india otherwise a day will come in future where  our coming generation will hv to ask for all the small small things to this muslims before doing it....&amp; hindu&#39;s will hv no power Good job aakash bhatia humans dont need religion they need law and strong state departments. Hindu blind extremists thinking. Go get help you filthy pagan! If a Hindu bear arms he is nationalist and gau rakshak , if a sikh person bear arms to avenge killing of his family members he is a terrorist or kashmiri talk about his problems he should go to Pakistan ,,, THATS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING i love christinity but i hate islam Don&#39;t divide India...British policy - divide n rule.. India is one i love u sir great speech Iske fact sahi ha There is nothing wrong in what he said. The horrors we Hindus face after letting Muslims stay here cannot be understood by everyone. Fuck Islam and Fuck Christianity. :) Jai Hindu Jai Bharat about sati... its a ritual ..dont coincide it with name of a women who was so proud to marry a guy having no lust or wealth and position in this materialistic life and still hold outstanding position in prestige .... and that prestige caused her own life .. its about values and sacrifice... and another is a pratha or ritual... <br>i always believe women are the most powerful among all... cause they have something that makes a man weak and go insane... or they may be the source of the indefinte power within the humanity. they can motivate you to be the best and worst... keeping the negative aspect in mind i wanna say some of our people started this sacrife to save the humiliating and scared part of life. think what will you do if you will become a burden in the society... cause u dont have a single source of livelihood... everything is gone with the man... that time women were less empowered to face these challenges and were vulnerable... these two arguenent of sati has no common basis.. you guys know tit n bit...<br>i agree...<br>Empty Vessel sound less... lol ! agenda and propaganda.... still I am proud to be Hindu! This is what you get when you vote MODI. Jai Sri Ram Sirji ..Mai Apni Baat karta hu Mai Apki baaton Se Sehmat hu..Secular hu Apne Desh ki Heet k liye Jaat Paat Mitane k liye ..

millions he also is mentally sick because of the trauma inflicted on his family during partition there are lacs like him in india including politicians, bureaucrats, businessmen inclusive of muslims, christians hindus &amp; sikhs who live in the murky past yet try to gain a better future, think psychological counselling is necessary for millions of people in our country as everybody has perverted views within their own individual social systems according to the environment they were raised up in. most of the hatred raked up in this country is by people displaced during partition, they were from a muslim dominated areas, the pakistanis also suffer from the same psyche except the traditional hindus from mainland india do not bother of such extreme views, neither do muslims as both hindu and muslim fanatics are doing nothing but spreading hate &amp; violence which is as dangerous to the country as daesh, al qaida or taliban, ill informed people can be more dangerous to society and the country as religious politicization or ideologists has always been a threat to peace and development of the world, whether they were christians, muslims hindus, budhists or any other culture or religion like rome, greece, aztecs, incas, persians. most of these radicals do not understand who is a hindu, the hindu word was coined in the sixteenth century by colonial rulers, the reals word is hind the land beyond the hindkhash mountain range and europeans called it indie due to pronunciation problem, there was no such thing as a hindu religion it was a way of life culture and dialects that varied from region to region in interpretation of religious texts during course of time, the indian culture is like a sponge that absorbs everything and gives its own interpretation of society of influences which emanates from inside the society or from outside. the variations are so numerous that a dynamic society needs but no place for violence. neem hakim khatra e jaan. average indian

और इसमें धर्म परिवर्तन को कोई प्रोत्साहन नही है क्योंकि यह धर्म अन्य सभी धर्मों को मान्यता देता है। बाकी ये दोनों धर्म, धर्म परिवर्तन और अन्य धर्मों की निंदा पर आधारित है। और इन दोनों धर्मो का मुख्य उद्देश्य हिन्दुओ को धर्म परिवर्तन कर जड़ से खत्म कर देना है। all comments happy taking tells want hear. that hinduism. that&#39;s satisfying ego. 💯 % correct bro minority religions creating lot

time 1500-1200 bc) says ‘ashvamedha’ ritual conducted kings involved sacrificing cows. ditto yagnas ‘rajasuya’ ‘vajapeya’. it says esteemed guests pay visit marriage ceremony held, serving beef duty host. rgveda sometimes refers guests ‘goghna’ meaning leads slaughter cow.<br>cattle much part life times ‘atharvaveda’ says, dead cremated, bull burnt departed person could hitch ride world.<br>manu, codified religious social norms hindus sometime around 200 bc — 200 ad, says camel meat eaten beef fine. says since animals created sacrificed, eating meat special occasions divine rule. according manu, sacrificed sacrificer would blessed higher status next life. yajnavalkya, highly respected sage lived mithila around 100-300 ad, declared “i, one, eat it, provided tender.”<br>even literary texts speak various kinds meat eaten castes people. mahabharatha — composed 8th 9th century bc — mentions pandavas banished forests, they, la salman khan, killed kinds wildlife food. at point time, draupadi offers jayadratha retinue loads deer meat. epic praises king called rantideva, whose kitchen two thousand cows butchered every day.<br>valmiki’s ramayana far behind comes beef. having origin sometime 5th century bc, ramayana speaks animal sacrifice means propitiate gods. not rama born father dasharatha conducted elaborate rituals involving sacrifice animals declared edible shastras, sita ferried across ganga yamuna, promised offer loads cow meat liquor rivers upon successful completion exile. not literary texts, medicinal theories ages past, recommend meat cures. caraka samhita says

restaurants government canteens india made sit take notice. believe protesters ignorant religion preaches. they simply going religious scriptures. <br><br>most world religions sanctify offering animals sacrifice including hinduism. hindu scriptures witnesses sacrifices killings animals consumption. references commands replete hindu scriptures manusmriti, vedas, upanishads, brahmins, grihsutras, dharmasutras others.<br><br>this column would suffice quoting references different scriptures imperative bring home point clear misconceptions:<br>manusmriti (chapter 5 / verse 30) says, “it sinful eat meat eatable animals, brahma created eaters eatables.” <br><br>manusmriti (5 / 35) states: when properly engaged ritual eat meat, death become sacrificial animal twenty-one rebirths. <br><br>maharishi yagyavalkya says shatpath brahmin (3/1/2/21) that, “i eat beef soft delicious.” <br>apastamb grihsutram (1/3/10) says, “the cow slaughtered arrival guest, occasion ‘shraddha’ ancestors occasion marriage.” <br>rigveda (10/85/13) declares, “on occasion girl’s marriage oxen cows slaughtered.” <br>rigveda (6/17/1) states “indra used eat meat cow, calf, horse buffalo.” <br>vashistha dharmasutra (11/34) writes, “if brahmin refuses eat meat offered occasion ‘shraddha’ worship, goes hell.”<br><br>also, comments great scholars hinduism worth noting:<br>· hinduism’s greatest propagator swami vivekanand thus: “you surprised according ancient hindu rites rituals, cannot good hindu eat beef”. (the complete works swami vivekanand, vol.3, p. 536).<br>· mukandilal writes book ‘cow slaughter – horns dilemma’, page 18: “in ancient india, cow-slaughter considered auspicious occasions ceremonies. bride groom used sit hide red ox front ‘vedi’ (alter).”<br>· a renowned scholar scriptures dr. pandurang vaman kane says, “bajsancyi samhita sanctifies beef-eating purity”. (dharmashastra vichar marathi, page 180)<br>· adi shankaracharya’ commentary brihdaranyakopanishad 6/4/18 says : ‘odan’ (rice) mixed meat called ‘mansodan’. on asked whose meat be, answers ‘uksha’. ‘uksha’ used ox, capable produce semen.<br>· book ‘the history culture indian people’, published bhartiya vidya bhawan, bombay edited renowned historian r.c.majumdar (vol.2, page 578) says: “this mahabharat king rantidev used kill two thousand animals addition two thousand cows daily order give meat charity”.<br><br>it seems great majority followers hinduism contact religious scriptures thus

acceptable. although, disagreements certain parts views muslims. but overall saying &quot; appeasement must stop, merit must come&quot;. donot see anything wrong gist. rss doesnt call attack minorities. so sad... mere hindu bhtbsare frnds koi inke jaise sochte nhi.. sb bht acche pata nhi yelog kahan aake hindu nam badnam kr rahe some people wonder leftists (or self claimed intellectuals) support extremely dogmatic mullas almost every time name liberalism despite contradictory ideologies, reasons them:<br> 1) since karl marx found nothing glorifiable indian history blame culture tradition poverty, inequality caste system society thus deliberately ignore dark brutal side invasion; hence wonder followers popularly known leftists spare chance power malign everything related hindu culture (if may use sanatana tradition). some leftists completely convinced western indologists without proper poorvapaksha(analysis), others confused ulteriar motives others ego (due belongingness already established popular fashionable elite ideology) way keeps denial mode almost everything related glory india. <br> <br> similarly, forcely converted muslims indian subcontinent (ashamed cowardice ancestors) suffering inferior complexity, try over-compensate kind superior complexity denouncing ancestry civilization attaching arabian although arabs take own. they try attach called legacy muhammad bin qasim, timur, ghazanvi aurangzeb type traitors (who broke thousands thousands temples responsible genocide lakhs innocent hindus), hide embarrassment ancetors couldn&#39;t resist agreed convert fear sword jaziya( special tax hindus) finally. although clever muslim scholars accept hindu ancestry point injustice inequality form caste system blame caste system fully responsible conversion external pressure. however would voice changed due sufism islam, see anywhere days still people converting. <br>by way, muslims marxists talk much caste system never want talk ashraf ( arabic word means &#39;noble&#39; includes undoubted descendants foreigners convert high caste hindus )and ajlaf ( contemptuous arabic term means &#39;wreteches&#39; &#39;mean people&#39; include mahomedans comprising occupational groups converts lower ranks; called kamina itar, &#39;base&#39; rasil, corruption rizal, &#39;wothless&#39;). <br>in places third class called arzal &#39;lowest all&#39;, added. with mahomedan would associate, forbidden enter mosque, use public burial ground. have anyone ever heard self claimed secular liberal intelletuals complain discrimination lower strata muslims? even somebody would dare speak this, leftists (whom call professinal mouners &#39;rudali&#39; desi bhasa) jump defend saying personal law safeguarded constitution itself. would unfortunatley constitution makers didn&#39;t address dicrimination communities making constitution.<br>and that&#39;s &#39;ghar wapsis&#39; &#39;bari fera&#39; going muslim community well, forced extremist hindu groups within.<br><br> yes everything culture perfect, yes caste system deliberately misinterpreted birth-based (instead individual&#39;s ability-based irrespective family background) self claimed brahmans greed centralizing power, wealth ,knowledge land; would uproot blot caste system soon society teaching people sanskrit, making shrutis (vedas upnishads) available every home updating smritis (which inculde shastras, kavyas puranas) mentioned scriptures already (well that&#39;s issue end menace), point talking leftists muslims bash everything &#39;desi&#39; due common hatred indian culture.<br><br> 2) marxist idea helping minority cost knocking majority suits muslims since strategy claiming minority (dar-al-harb) giving rights minorities majority (dar-al-islam) indoctrinated strategy quran, known al-taqiyya spreading islam hook crook. reason would see leftists muslims often ask hindus tolerance mutual-respect (respect respect disrespect disrespect irrespective showing first) deterrence well hypocrisy tolerance can&#39;t stand idea mutual-respect hence can&#39;t bring genuine acceptance society ever.<br> <br> look, everybody knows religiously intolerant muslims non-believers (kafirs) get adequate number side. otherwise challenge, anyone explain soon govt would bring population policy equally applicable communities, muslims start crying? can muslim brother justify single muslim majority country democratic secular except turkey, malaysia whose condition getting worsened wahabism since last decade indonesia yet given hindu culture adopting new religion? my point therefore hypocrisy demanding (like reservation employment accepting uniform civil code, etc) hiding behind secularism democracy minority; showing true colors (by killing non-believers qayamat reduce servants) majority indoctrination al-taqiyya would never go, matter much chant &quot;islam religion peace&quot;.<br><br> 3) although leftists muslims logic nationhood, common believe territorial boundaries.<br> <br> leftists believe boundaries every 2 nation dismissed since world single place whole therefore everybody right wonder anywhere &quot;global village&quot; humanitarian basis. however, contradict saying india nation,it subaltern nation disintegrated among various provinces (as independence, that&#39;s sardar vallabhai patel convincing 450 provinces 600 stay india) based language, culture, region, ethnicity, etc..<br><br> and, muslims according overwhelmly popular, dominant widely accepted school thoughts wahabsm(sunni dominated concept), preached believe religion permanent basis nationhood. even civilization culture emerge religion according them. they believe motherland fatherland concept, every single territory another piece land life hence invaded caliphate disintegrated invade indoctrinated strategy al-taqiyya. but reason give cunningly people never place human history always migrated place another search food,shelter security natural hazards survival, fact people ancient age got evolved found ways staying place i.e cultivation cattle farming, used roam. but soon people developed new ways settling surviving without running place another, concept civilization came consequently brought concept culture comprising language, food,belief systems,etc.<br><br>but important thing way see self claimed intellectuals defend islamic invasions dogmas making fear would talk much wish islamic riyasat-e-caliphate, ghazwa-e-hind, ummah (loyalty international community), al-taqiyya(based hypocritical concepts dar-al-islam, dar-al-harab dar-al-amn), would violent. hypocritical rubbish reasoning, think could give intellect justify important cricize hindu extremeism instead islamic intentions worldwide cunningly turning allegation islamophile upon islamophobe. brainwashed bhaktard rest bhaktard fellows.....pathetic..feel pity people....living world far reality.....the organisations

में लिखा है। वे बर्मा में भी आतंक फैला रहे हैं और बहुत सारे हिन्दुओ को मा रहे हैं। मुसलमान जहां भी जाते हैं मेहमान बन के जाते लेकिन उसके बाद वे अपना हक़ मांगने लग जाते है। सिरिया से भी जो मुसलमान यूरोप वगैर जा रहें हैं वो कुछ सालों बाद अपना हक़ मांगने लगेंगे और तीसरा विश्वयुद्ध इन के ही कारण होने वाला है। इससे जाहिर है कि हमको अपना भारत इनसे बचाना होगा।में आप सब से अनुरोध करता हूँ कि आप सब 2019 के चुनावों में भी मोदी को अपना वोट देकर जिताएं। केजरू और राहुल जैसे चुतियो को तो सिर्फ सत्ता चैहिये और इसके लिए वो तो ओवैसी के जूते भी चाटना शुरू कर देंगे। 🇮🇳 half fact stated person lies fake.this

वासियों ने लड़की छेड़ना मुसलमानो के आने से सीखा। मै पूछना चाहता हूँ कि पनघट पर गोपियों को छुप छुपकर कंकर मारने कौन जाता था। सीता जी को अपहरण करके ले जाने वाला रावण किस धर्म को मानता था। और मैं आप को बता दूं कि रामायण के हिसाब से दुराचारी रावण शिव का भक्त था। तथा सति प्रथा के अनुसार स्त्रियों को जिंदा जलाने वाले कौन थे।और पाँच पांडव अपनी पत्नी की इतनी ही इज्जत करते थे तो उन्होंने अपनी पत्नी को जुए की बाजी में क्यों लगाया। शायद उन्होंने इसलिए लगाया क्योंकि उनके लिए उनकी पत्नी एक वस्तु थी। modi bhakt h, inka purana funda pehle logon musalmano darao phir bjp ko maseeha banao iski chakal dekho cow

sudhroge tum sab terrorist banjao unke jaisa desh nikallo! bible tu ek verse padke baat karra pagal! christians peaceful people world!🙄 kisi bhai paas agar jawab hain please ...i waiting <br>1:- सभी देवी देवताओ ने भारत मे हि जन्म क्यो लिया? क्यो किसी भी देवी देवता को भारत के बाहर कोइ नही जानता ? 2:- जितने भी देवी देवता देवताओ की सवारीया है उनमे सिर्फ वही जानवर क्यो है जो कि भारत मे ही पाये जाते है? एसे जानवर क्यो नही जो कि सिर्फ कुछ हि देशो मे पाये जाते है, जैसे कि कंगारु, जिराफ आदी !! 3:- सभी देवी देवता हमेशा राज घरानो मे हि जन्म क्यो लेते थे ? क्यो किसी भी देवी देवता ने किसी गरीब या शुद्र के यहा जन्म नही लिया? ? 4:- पोराणीक कथाओ मे सभी देवी देवताओ की दिनचर्या का वर्णन है जैसे कि कब पार्वती ने चंदन से स्नान किया, कब गणेश के लिये लड्डु बनाये, गणेश ने कैसे लड्डु खाये.. आदी लेकीन जैसे हि ग्रंथो कि स्क्रीप्ट खत्म हो गयी भगवानो कि दिनचर्या भी खत्म.. तो क्या बाद में सभी देवीदेवताऔ का देहांत हो गया ?? 6:- जब भी कोइ पापी पाप फैलाता था तो उसका नाश करने के लिये खुद भागवान किसी राजा के यहा जन्म लेते थे फिर 30-35 की उम्र तक जवान होने के बाद वो पापी का नाश करते थे, ऐसा क्यों? पापी का नाश जब भगवान खुद हि कर रहे है तो 30-35 साल का इतना ज्यादा वक्त क्यो??? भगवान सिधे कुछ क्यो नही करते?? जीस प्रकार उन्होने अपने खुद के ही भक्तो का उत्तराखण्ड मे नाश किया ? (8) अगर हिन्दू धर्म के अनुसार एक जीवित पत्नी के रहते, दूसरा विवाह अनुचित है, तो फिर राम के पिता दशरथ ने चार विवाह किस नीति अनुसार किये थे? (9) अगर शिव के पुत्र गनेश की गर्दन शिव ने काट दी, तो फिर यह कैसा भगवान है?? जो उस कटी गर्दन को उसी जगह पर क्यों नहीं जोड़ सका?? क्यों एक पिरपराध जानवर (हाथी) की हत्या करके उसकी गर्दन गणेश की धढ पर लगाई? एक इंसान के बच्चे के धढ़ पर हाथी की गर्दन कैसे फिट आ गयी? (10) अगर हिन्दू धर्म में मांसाहार वर्जित है, तो फिर राम स्वर्णमृग (हिरन) को मारने क्यों गए थे? क्या मृग हत्या जीव हत्या नहीं है?<br>5:- ग्रंथो के अनुसार पुराने समय मे सभी देवी देवताओ का पृथ्वी पर आना-जाना लगा रहता था। जैसे कि किसी को वरदान देने या किसी पापी का सर्वनाश करने.. लेकीन अब एसा क्या हुआ जो देवी देवताओ ने पृथ्वी पर आना बंद हि कर दिया?? (7) अगर हिन्दू धर्म कई हज़ार साल पुराना है, तो फिर भारत के बाहर इसका प्रचार-प्रसार क्यों नहीं हुआ और एक भारत से बाहर के धर्म “इस्लाम-ईसाई” को इतनी मान्यता कैसे हासिल हुई? वो आपके अपने पुरातन हिन्दू धर्म से ज़्यादा अनुयायी कैसे बना सका? हिन्दू देवी-देवता उन्हें नहीं रोक रहें?? (11) राम अगर भगवान है, तो फिर उसको यह क्यों नहीं पता था कि रावण की नाभि में अमृत है? अगर उसको घर का भेदी ना बताता कि रावण की नाभि में अमृत है, तो उस युद्ध में रावण कभी नहीं मारा जाता। क्या भगवन ऐसा होता है? (12) तुम कहते हो कि कृष्ण तुम्हारे भगवन हैं, तो क्या नहाती हुई निर्वस्त्र गोपीयों को छुपकर देखने वाला व्यक्ति, भगवान हो सकता है? अगर ऐसा काम कोई व्यक्ति आज के दौर में करे, तो हम उसे छिछोरा-नालायक कहते हैं। तो आप कृष्ण को भगवान क्यों कहते हो? (13) हिन्दूओ में बलात्कारीयोंका प्रमाण अधिक क्यों होते हैं? (15) खुजराहो के मंदिरों में काम-क्रीड़ा और उत्तेजक चित्र हैं, फिर ऐसे स्थान को मंदिर क्यों कहा जाता है? क्या काम-क्रीडा, हिन्दू धर्मानुसार पूजनीय है? sir just told truth !! no islam kill hate non
